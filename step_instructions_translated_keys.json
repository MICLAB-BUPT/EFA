  "Pull Up": [
    "action step 1: The player should start by finding a pull-up bar that allows their feet to hang freely without touching the ground.  Adjust the height if necessary, or use a box or platform to reach the bar comfortably.",
    "action step 2: The player should grip the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing away), slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.  Experiment with grip width to find what feels strongest and most comfortable, but start just outside shoulder width.",
    "action step 3: The player should begin from a dead hang, with arms fully extended and shoulders relaxed (but engaged).  Avoid swinging or kipping; the movement should be controlled.",
    "action step 4: The player should initiate the pull by engaging their back and shoulder muscles, pulling their shoulder blades down and back.  Think about pulling their elbows down towards their ribs, rather than just pulling with the arms.",
    "action step 5: The player should continue pulling until their chin is above the bar.  Avoid craning the neck; maintain a neutral head position throughout the movement, and then slowly lower back down to the starting dead hang position with full control.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on controlled movements throughout the entire exercise.  Start with assisted pull-ups (using resistance bands or a partner) if unable to perform a full pull-up. Prioritize good form over the number of repetitions, and gradually increase repetitions as strength improves. Breathe out as you pull yourself up and breathe in as you lower yourself down. Consistent practice, even with variations and assistance, is key to mastering the pull-up."
  ],
  "Barbell Bench Press": [
    "action step 1: The player should lie face-up on a flat bench with their feet flat on the floor, ensuring a stable base.  Their eyes should be roughly aligned with the barbell in the rack.",
    "action step 2: The player should grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip.  Ensure a consistent grip width for each repetition and set.",
    "action step 3: The player should unrack the barbell with the help of a spotter (recommended), or carefully lift it off the rack themselves, maintaining straight arms. The barbell should be positioned directly over their chest, with elbows locked.",
    "action step 4: The player should slowly lower the barbell down towards their chest, maintaining control throughout the descent.  Touch the barbell to their lower chest (around the nipple line) or slightly below, keeping their elbows at roughly a 45-75 degree angle to their body (not flared out completely to the sides nor tucked completely into the sides).",
    "action step 5: The player should push the barbell back up to the starting position, extending their arms fully but avoiding a violent lockout of the elbows. Maintain a controlled and steady pressing motion, focusing on using chest muscles.",
    "general instruction: The player should always use a spotter, especially when lifting heavier weights. Warm up properly before attempting the bench press. Focus on maintaining proper form throughout the exercise to avoid injury. Breathe out as you push the weight up, and breathe in as you lower the weight. Start with a lighter weight to master the technique before increasing the load. Control the descent and ascent, never let the barbell crash down."
  ],
  "Barbell Bent-Over Row": [
    "action step 1: The player should stand with their feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width. Knees should be slightly bent, and the back should be straight.",
    "action step 2: The player should hinge at the hips, pushing their hips back and lowering their torso until it's almost parallel to the floor. Maintain a straight back and a neutral head position (looking slightly ahead, not down at the feet).",
    "action step 3: The player should let the barbell hang straight down from their shoulders, with their arms fully extended. This is the starting position.",
    "action step 4: The player should pull the barbell up towards their lower chest or upper abdomen, keeping their elbows close to their body.  Focus on squeezing their shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.",
    "action step 5: The player should slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent.  Avoid rounding the back or using momentum to swing the weight.",
    "general instruction: The player should maintain a straight back throughout the entire exercise to prevent injury. Start with a lighter weight to master the technique before increasing the load. Breathe out as you pull the weight up and breathe in as you lower it. If you feel any pain in your lower back, stop immediately. A slight bend in the knees is crucial for stability and back protection. Focus on using your back muscles, not your arms, to lift the weight. Keep core tight to protect spine."
  ],
  "Barbell Upright Row": [
    "action step 1: The player should stand with their feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell with an overhand grip, hands closer than shoulder-width apart (about 6-12 inches). The barbell should rest in front of their thighs.",
    "action step 2: The player should keep their back straight, core engaged, and chest up throughout the exercise. Maintain a slight bend in the knees.",
    "action step 3: The player should initiate the lift by pulling the barbell straight up, keeping it close to their body. The elbows should lead the movement, moving out and up to the sides.",
    "action step 4: The player should continue pulling until the barbell reaches chest level or slightly below, and their elbows are higher than their wrists. Avoid pulling the bar too high, as this can put excessive stress on the shoulder joints.",
    "action step 5: The player should slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent. Avoid letting the weight drop quickly.",
    "general instruction: The player should use a weight that allows them to maintain proper form throughout the entire exercise. Avoid using momentum to swing the weight. Breathe out as you pull the barbell up and breathe in as you lower it. This exercise can be strenuous on the shoulder joints, so it's important to use proper form and a moderate weight. If you have pre-existing shoulder problems, consult with a doctor or physical therapist before performing this exercise. Keep core engaged and back straight."
  ],
  "Barbell Deadlift": [
    "action step 1: The player should approach the barbell, positioning their feet hip-width apart with the bar over the mid-foot (about an inch from the shins).  Toes can be pointed slightly outwards, finding what feels most stable and natural for your hip structure.",
    "action step 2: The player should bend at the hips and knees, gripping the bar just outside the legs with an overhand or mixed grip (one hand overhand, one hand underhand).  Maintain a flat back, ensuring a neutral spine by engaging your core and pulling your shoulder blades down and back.",
    "action step 3: The player should take a deep breath and brace the core, as if preparing to be punched in the stomach.  Think about pulling the slack out of the bar by engaging the lats and creating tension throughout the body before the weight leaves the ground.",
    "action step 4: The player should initiate the lift by driving through the heels, extending the legs and hips simultaneously.  Keep the bar close to the body, dragging it up the shins and thighs, maintaining a straight back throughout the movement.",
    "action step 5: The player should continue extending until standing upright with the hips and knees fully locked out, maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core.  Lower the bar under control by reversing the movement, pushing the hips back first, then bending the knees, keeping the bar close to the body.",
    "general instruction: The player should prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight, especially when starting.  Focus on controlled movements throughout the entire lift, both the concentric (lifting) and eccentric (lowering) phases.  Consider recording yourself to check your form, and don't hesitate to ask for feedback from a qualified coach. Start with a light weight and gradually increase it as your strength and technique improve.  Remember to breathe and brace effectively for each repetition.  Listen to your body and avoid pushing through pain."
  ],
  "Barbell Glute Bridge": [
    "action step 1: The player should lie face up on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.  Position the barbell across the hips, resting it in the hip crease – using a pad or folded towel can make this more comfortable.",
    "action step 2: The player should place their hands on the barbell to stabilize it, ensuring a secure grip. Keep your arms relatively straight, but not locked out, acting primarily to keep the bar from rolling.",
    "action step 3: The player should take a deep breath and brace the core, engaging the abdominal muscles. Think about pulling your belly button towards your spine to maintain a stable torso.",
    "action step 4: The player should drive through the heels, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. Avoid hyperextending the lower back; focus on achieving full hip extension by contracting the glutes.",
    "action step 5: The player should hold the bridge position for a brief pause at the top, maintaining glute engagement, and then slowly lower the hips back down to the floor with control.  Avoid letting the hips drop quickly or touching the ground forcefully.",
    "general instruction: The player should start with bodyweight glute bridges to master the form before adding the barbell. Focus on feeling the glutes working throughout the exercise, minimizing the involvement of the hamstrings or lower back.  If you feel it primarily in your lower back, adjust your foot position (closer or further from your hips) and ensure you are actively squeezing your glutes.  Control the movement throughout, both on the way up and down.  Gradually increase the weight as you get stronger and maintain good form. You may also experiment with foot placement (narrower or wider stance) to target different areas of the glutes."
  ],
  "Barbell Stiff-leg Deadlift": [
    "action step 1: The player should stand with feet hip-width apart, with the barbell over mid-foot. The shins should be almost touching the bar, but with slightly straighter legs than a conventional deadlift setup.",
    "action step 2: The player should hinge at the hips, pushing the hips back while maintaining a slight bend in the knees. Keep the back straight and neutral, avoiding any rounding of the spine, grip the bar with an overhand or mixed grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.",
    "action step 3: The player should take a deep breath and brace the core, engaging the abdominal muscles and lats. Maintain tension in the hamstrings and feel a stretch as you lower the bar.",
    "action step 4: The player should lower the barbell by continuing to push the hips back, keeping the bar close to the legs and maintaining a slight bend in the knees.  Lower the bar as far as flexibility allows while maintaining a neutral spine; it's okay if the bar doesn't touch the floor.",
    "action step 5: The player should reverse the motion by driving through the heels, extending the hips, and squeezing the glutes, keeping the back straight. Maintain the slight knee bend throughout the entire lift, stand up fully at the top but don’t hyperextend.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on feeling the stretch in the hamstrings during the eccentric (lowering) phase. Start with a very light weight to master the hip hinge movement and ensure proper form. Avoid rounding the back at all costs; if you can't maintain a neutral spine, reduce the range of motion. The knees should remain *slightly* bent throughout; this is not a straight-leg deadlift. Control the weight throughout the entire lift. Imagine pushing your hips back as far as possible as you lower the weight, rather than simply bending over. This exercise targets the hamstrings and glutes, so focus on feeling those muscles work."
  ],
  "Barbell Back Squat": [
    "action step 1: The player should set up with the barbell resting across the upper back, either in a high-bar position (on top of the trapezius muscles) or a low-bar position (across the rear deltoids, below the spine of the scapula).  Choose the position that feels most comfortable and allows for a stable, upright torso.",
    "action step 2: The player should stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly outward.  Find a stance width that allows you to squat deeply and comfortably while maintaining balance.",
    "action step 3: The player should take a deep breath and brace the core, creating intra-abdominal pressure to support the spine.  Think about pulling your ribcage down and tightening your abdominal muscles.",
    "action step 4: The player should initiate the squat by simultaneously bending at the hips and knees, maintaining a neutral spine and keeping the chest up.  Descend until the hip crease is below the top of the knee (parallel) or to a depth that is comfortable and allows for good form.",
    "action step 5: The player should drive through the heels, extending the hips and knees simultaneously to return to the starting position. Maintain a consistent back angle throughout the ascent and keep the core braced.",
    "general instruction: The player should prioritize proper form over weight, especially when starting. Focus on maintaining a neutral spine and controlled movement throughout the entire lift.  Ensure your knees track over your toes, avoiding excessive inward or outward movement.  Start with a light weight or just the bar to practice the movement pattern.  Consider recording yourself to check your form, and don't hesitate to ask for feedback from a qualified coach.  Depth is important, but not at the expense of good form; find a depth that you can consistently achieve with proper technique.  Breathe deeply and brace effectively for each repetition.  Listen to your body and avoid pushing through pain."
  ],
  "Barbell Front Squat": [
    "action step 1: The player should set up with the barbell resting across the front of the shoulders, close to the throat, supported by the anterior deltoids.  The player can use a clean grip (fingertips under the bar, elbows high) or a cross-arm grip (arms crossed over the bar, hands gripping the bar).",
    "action step 2: The player should stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly outward. Maintain an upright torso, keeping the chest up and the elbows high (especially with the clean grip).",
    "action step 3: The player should take a deep breath and brace the core, creating intra-abdominal pressure to support the spine.  Maintaining a tight core is crucial for stability in the front squat.",
    "action step 4: The player should initiate the squat by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously, keeping the torso as upright as possible. Descend until the hip crease is below the top of the knee (parallel) or to a comfortable depth while maintaining good form.",
    "action step 5: The player should drive through the heels, extending the hips and knees to return to the starting position, keeping the elbows high and chest up. Maintain a consistent, upright torso throughout the ascent.",
    "general instruction: The player should prioritize maintaining an upright torso throughout the lift; this is the key difference from the back squat. Start with a very light weight or just the bar to master the rack position and movement pattern. If using the clean grip, wrist flexibility is important; if you lack flexibility, consider using straps or the cross-arm grip. Focus on keeping your elbows high throughout the lift, especially with the clean grip, to prevent the bar from rolling forward.  Ensure your knees track over your toes. Breathe deeply and brace effectively for each repetition.  The front squat emphasizes the quadriceps more than the back squat. Listen to your body and avoid pushing through pain, especially in the wrists or shoulders."
  ],
  "Incline Barbell Bench Press": [
    "action step 1: The player should lie on an incline bench (typically set between 30 and 45 degrees) with feet flat on the floor.  The eyes should be directly under the barbell when it's racked.",
    "action step 2: The player should grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using a full grip (thumb wrapped around the bar).  The grip width can be adjusted based on comfort and individual biomechanics, but avoid excessively wide or narrow grips.",
    "action step 3: The player should unrack the barbell with the arms extended, keeping the wrists straight and the elbows slightly unlocked.  Take a deep breath and brace the core, engaging the abdominal muscles.",
    "action step 4: The player should lower the barbell under control, touching it to the upper chest (around the clavicle or upper sternum). Keep the elbows tucked in at a roughly 45-75 degree angle to the body, avoiding excessive flaring.",
    "action step 5: The player should push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. Exhale during the upward push, and keep the core engaged throughout the movement.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on controlled movements throughout the entire lift, both the lowering (eccentric) and pressing (concentric) phases.  Start with a light weight to master the form and find the appropriate grip width and bench angle. Avoid bouncing the bar off the chest.  Maintain a stable base by keeping your feet firmly planted on the floor and your back and glutes in contact with the bench.  The incline bench press emphasizes the upper chest and anterior deltoids. A spotter is recommended, especially when lifting heavier weights. Listen to your body, and if pain appears, please stop."
  ],
  "Dcline Barbell Bench Press": [
    "action step 1: The player should lie on a decline bench (typically set between 15 and 30 degrees) with feet secured under the pads. The eyes should be positioned slightly below the barbell when it's racked, ensuring a safe and efficient unrack.",
    "action step 2: The player should grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using a full grip (thumb wrapped around the bar). A slightly narrower grip than a flat bench press is often used, but find what feels strongest and most comfortable.",
    "action step 3: The player should unrack the barbell with arms extended, keeping wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked. Take a deep breath and brace the core, engaging the abdominal muscles to stabilize the torso.",
    "action step 4: The player should lower the barbell under control, touching it to the lower chest (near the bottom of the sternum).  Keep the elbows tucked in, maintaining a roughly 45-degree angle to the body; avoid excessive flaring to protect the shoulders.",
    "action step 5: The player should push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. Exhale forcefully during the upward push, keeping the core and glutes engaged throughout the movement.",
    "general instruction: The player should prioritize controlled movements, especially during the lowering phase. Start with a lighter weight to master the form and find a comfortable grip width and bench angle. The decline bench press emphasizes the lower portion of the pectoralis major muscles. Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest. A spotter is highly recommended for this exercise, as the angle can make it more difficult to re-rack the weight safely. Ensure your feet are securely locked under the pads to prevent sliding down the bench. Listen to your body, and if pain happens, please stop doing it and ask a professional for assistance."

  "Parallel Bars Leg Raise": [
    "action step 1: The player should position themselves on the parallel bars with arms fully extended and supporting the body weight. Keep the shoulders down and back, avoiding shrugging, and maintain a straight body posture.",
    "action step 2: The player should engage the core muscles, drawing the navel towards the spine and maintaining a slight posterior pelvic tilt (tucking the tailbone slightly). This will help stabilize the body and prevent swinging.",
    "action step 3: The player should take a breath and, keeping the legs straight (or with a slight bend in the knees if necessary), slowly raise the legs upwards. The movement should be controlled and initiated from the hip flexors and lower abdominal muscles.",
    "action step 4: The player should raise the legs until they are parallel to the floor, or higher if flexibility allows, while maintaining control and avoiding swinging. Focus on contracting the abdominal muscles throughout the movement.",
    "action step 5: The player should slowly lower the legs back to the starting position, resisting the urge to drop them quickly. Maintain core engagement throughout the entire exercise, both the lifting (concentric) and lowering (eccentric) phases.",
    "general instruction: The player should prioritize proper form and control over the height of the leg raise. Start with small, controlled movements and gradually increase the range of motion as strength and flexibility improve. Avoid swinging the legs or using momentum to lift them. If straight leg raises are too difficult, start with bent-knee raises, bringing the knees towards the chest. Maintain a tight grip on the bars and keep the shoulders stable. Breathe out as you raise your legs and breathe in as you lower them. This exercise primarily targets the lower abdominal muscles and hip flexors. Listen to your body and avoid pushing through any pain, particularly in the lower back."

    "action step 2: The player should stand with feet shoulder-width apart, or slightly wider, with toes pointed slightly outward. Foot placement can be adjusted forward or backward slightly to find the most comfortable and stable position, differing from a free-weight squat.",
    "action step 3: The player should take a deep breath and brace the core, engaging the abdominal muscles to stabilize the torso.  Keep the chest up and back straight.",
    "action step 4: The player should unrack the bar and initiate the squat by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously, maintaining a neutral spine.  Descend until the thighs are parallel to the floor (or to a comfortable depth while maintaining good form).",
    "action step 5: The player should drive through the heels, extending the hips and knees to return to the starting position. Maintain a consistent back angle throughout the ascent and keep the core braced. Exhale as you stand up.",
    "general instruction: The player should prioritize proper form over weight. The Smith machine provides a fixed path of motion, which can be beneficial for beginners learning the squat pattern, but it also limits the engagement of stabilizing muscles. Focus on controlled movements and maintaining a neutral spine. Foot placement is crucial in the Smith machine squat; experiment with different positions to find what feels best for your body and allows for proper depth. Avoid placing the feet too far forward, as this can put excessive stress on the knees. Unlike free-weight squats, you don't have to balance the bar, so concentrate purely on the up-and-down movement. Listen to your body and avoid pushing through pain."

  "Scissor Kick": [
    "action step 1: The player should lie on their back with legs extended towards the ceiling. Keep your legs straight, or with a very slight bend at the knees if necessary, and point your toes. Place your hands behind your head, lightly supporting it with your fingertips, or extend them down by your sides, palms down.",
    "action step 2: The player should lift their head and shoulders off the mat (optional). Curl your upper body off the mat to the base of your shoulder blades, engaging your core. If this is too challenging, you can keep your head and shoulders down.",
    "action step 3: The player should lower one leg towards the mat while keeping the other leg up. Inhale and lower your right leg towards the floor, keeping it as straight as possible and hovering it just above the mat. Keep your left leg extended towards the ceiling.",
    "action step 4: The player should switch legs in a scissoring motion. Exhale and switch legs, bringing your right leg up towards the ceiling and lowering your left leg towards the floor. The movement should be controlled and fluid, like a pair of scissors.",
    "action step 5: The player should continue alternating legs for the desired repetitions. Continue the scissoring motion, coordinating your breath with the movement: inhale for one switch, exhale for the next. Maintain core engagement and keep your lower back pressed towards the mat (or maintaining a neutral spine if there is a small natural curve).",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on controlled movements and avoid using momentum. The Scissor Kick is a core-strengthening exercise that also improves flexibility in the hamstrings. Keep your neck relaxed and your gaze towards your legs, or straight up if your head is down. If you feel any strain in your lower back, you can modify the exercise by bending your knees slightly or by reducing the range of motion (not lowering your legs as close to the floor). Start with a smaller number of repetitions and gradually increase as you get stronger. Focus on maintaining proper form throughout the exercise."

  "Bent Knee Leg Raise": [
    "action step 1: The player should lie on their back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your arms at your sides, palms down.  Ensure your spine is in a neutral position - for most, that means a small space between your lower back and the floor.",
    "action step 2: The player should engage their core muscles.  Before you begin the lift, draw your navel towards your spine, activating your deep abdominal muscles.  This will help stabilize your lower back.",
    "action step 3: The player should lift both knees towards their chest, maintaining the bend.  Keeping your knees bent at a 90-degree angle, slowly lift both legs off the floor, bringing your knees towards your chest.  The movement should come from your lower abdominals, not momentum.",
    "action step 4: The player should lower their feet back towards the floor with control. Slowly and deliberately lower your feet back towards the floor, maintaining the bent-knee position.  Tap your toes lightly on the floor, or hover them just above the floor for a greater challenge.",

    "general instruction: The player should focus on using their core muscles, not momentum, to lift and lower their legs.  Bent Knee Leg Raises are an effective exercise for strengthening the lower abdominal muscles. Breathe out as you lift your knees, and breathe in as you lower them. If you feel any strain in your lower back, reduce the range of motion – don't bring your knees as close to your chest.  You can also place your hands under your hips for added support, but ensure this doesn't encourage you to arch your back.  Start with a small number of repetitions and gradually increase as you get stronger."

    "action step 3: The player should engage their core and maintain a straight body line. Tighten your abdominal muscles, glutes, and thighs to prevent your hips from sagging or your back from arching. Imagine pulling your navel towards your spine.",
    "action step 4: The player should hold the plank position, maintaining proper form. Keep your body rigid and avoid any movement. Breathe steadily and deeply. Focus on maintaining a neutral spine and neck; look down at the floor, slightly in front of your hands.",
    "action step 5: The player should hold for the desired duration, then lower to the knees. Hold the plank for the set time, then gently lower your knees back to the floor to come out of the pose. Avoid collapsing or dropping your hips suddenly.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on maintaining proper form throughout the entire exercise, even if it means holding the plank for a shorter duration. The Plank is an isometric exercise that strengthens the core, shoulders, and back. Common mistakes include sagging hips, arching the back, and holding your breath. If you're a beginner, start with shorter holds (e.g., 10-20 seconds) and gradually increase the duration as you get stronger. You can modify the plank by performing it on your knees instead of your toes. If you feel any pain in your lower back, stop immediately and adjust your form or try a modification."

    "general instruction: The player should focus on maintaining proper form throughout the entire exercise. The squat is a fundamental exercise that strengthens the legs and glutes.  Breathe in as you lower down, and breathe out as you stand up.  Common mistakes include rounding the back, letting the knees cave inward, and lifting the heels off the floor.  If you're a beginner, you can start with a shallower squat and gradually increase the depth as you get stronger. You can also use a chair or bench to help you learn the proper movement pattern, lightly touching it with your glutes at the bottom of each rep. Keep your gaze forward or slightly upward."

    "action step 5: The player should lower their head and shoulders back down with control. Inhale and slowly lower your head and shoulders back towards the floor, maintaining control. Avoid letting your head drop suddenly.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on using their abdominal muscles, not their neck or momentum, to lift and lower their upper body. The Curl-up/Crunch is a core exercise that primarily targets the rectus abdominis (the \"six-pack\" muscles). Keep your movements slow and controlled. Breathe out as you curl up, and breathe in as you lower down. If you feel any strain in your neck, you can place one hand behind your head for support, but avoid pulling. Start with a smaller number of repetitions and gradually increase as you get stronger. Focus on quality over quantity; a few well-executed crunches are better than many poorly performed ones. The range of motion is relatively small; you are *not* trying to sit all the way up."

    "action step 5: The player should continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions. Continue the twisting motion, coordinating your breath with the movement: exhale as you twist, inhale as you return to center.  Maintain core engagement throughout.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on a controlled twisting motion from the core, not momentum or pulling on the neck. The Sicilian Crunch emphasizes oblique engagement more than a standard crunch. Keep your movements slow and deliberate. Avoid pulling on your head with your hands; your hands are only there for light support.  Imagine there's an apple between your chin and chest, and you don't want to crush it. Breathe deeply and consistently. If you feel any strain in your lower back, reduce the range of motion or try placing your feet slightly wider apart. The lift of the head and shoulders is minimal; this is *not* a full sit-up. The power comes from the rotation."

    "action step 4: The player should maintain an upright torso, avoiding leaning forward or backward excessively.  You can place your hands on your front thigh for balance, or raise them overhead for a deeper stretch if comfortable.",
    "action step 5: The player should hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply and evenly. Then, gently push off with the front foot to return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on feeling a gentle stretch in the hip flexor of the back leg, not a sharp pain. If you feel any pain in your knees or lower back, reduce the depth of the lunge. Listen to your body and don't push beyond a comfortable range of motion. Gradually increase the hold time and step size as flexibility improves."

    "action step 5: The player should hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply and evenly. Slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on a gentle stretch in the abdominal area, not a forceful backbend. If you feel any pain in your lower back, ease off the stretch immediately.  This stretch, often called the Cobra Pose in yoga, is most effective when the abdominal muscles are relaxed. Avoid tensing the abdominals during the stretch.  Listen to your body and only stretch as far as is comfortable. Progress gradually."

    "action step 3: The player should gently lean forward towards the wall, keeping the back heel down and the back leg straight. You should feel a stretch in the calf muscle of the straight leg (gastrocnemius).",
    "action step 4: The player should, to target the soleus muscle (deeper calf muscle), slightly bend the back knee while maintaining the heel on the ground. This subtle change shifts the stretch lower down the calf.",
    "action step 5: The player should hold each variation of the stretch (straight leg and slightly bent knee) for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply. Switch legs and repeat.",
    "general instruction: The player should ensure the back heel remains on the ground throughout the stretch to maximize its effectiveness. Avoid bouncing or forcing the stretch; it should be a gradual, sustained stretch. If you feel any pain in your Achilles tendon, ease off the stretch.  Consistent stretching is key to improving calf flexibility. You can also perform this stretch on a slightly elevated surface, like a step, by letting your heel hang off the edge (be cautious and hold onto something for support)."

If you feel any pain in your knee, ease off the stretch immediately. You should feel the stretch primarily in the quadriceps muscle."
  ],
  "Hamstring stretch": [
    "action step 1: The player should sit on the floor with legs extended straight out in front of them. If you find it difficult to sit upright with straight legs, sit on a folded blanket or cushion to elevate your hips.",
    "action step 2: The player should, keeping your back as straight as possible, gently widen your legs, forming a 'V' shape. Go as wide as is comfortable without straining; it's not necessary to achieve a full split.",
    "action step 3: The player should, maintaining a straight back, hinge forward from your hips, reaching towards your toes, your shins, or your ankles, wherever is comfortable. Avoid rounding your back.",
    "action step 4: The player should feel a stretch along the back of your legs (hamstrings) and potentially in your inner thighs. Hold this position, breathing deeply and evenly.",
    "action step 5: The player should maintain the stretch for 20-30 seconds. Slowly sit back up. You can repeat this stretch by reaching towards one leg at a time, focusing the stretch on one hamstring.",
    "general instruction: The player should prioritize keeping your back straight rather than reaching your toes. Think about lengthening your spine and bringing your chest towards your thighs, not your head towards your knees. If you have very tight hamstrings, you may need to bend your knees slightly; this is okay, gradually work towards straightening them over time. Never bounce or force the stretch. If you feel any sharp pain, especially in your lower back, ease off the stretch immediately. Consistent stretching is more effective and safer than aggressive stretching."

    "action step 5: The player should maintain the stretch for 20-30 seconds. Slowly return to an upright position and repeat on the other side.",
    "general instruction: The player should avoid leaning forward or backward; the bend should be directly to the side. Imagine you are sandwiched between two panes of glass. If you feel any pinching or sharp pain in your lower back, ease off the stretch. You can place your opposite hand on your hip for support and to help maintain your balance. Focus on lengthening your spine as you bend to the side, rather than collapsing into the stretch. You can modify the stretch by sitting on the floor with legs crossed, or even kneeling."

    "action step 4: The player should land softly on the balls of your feet, maintaining a quick and rhythmic pace. Avoid landing heavily on your heels.",
    "action step 5: The player should continue the high knee motion for a designated number of repetitions, distance or a specified time. Maintain good posture and controlled movements throughout.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on lifting your knees high rather than on forward speed. Keep your core engaged to protect your lower back and improve stability. Breathe rhythmically throughout the exercise. If you're a beginner, start with a slower pace and lower knee height, gradually increasing the intensity as you get stronger. This is a dynamic warm-up exercise, so it's important to maintain a controlled movement; it's not a stretch."

    "action step 5: The player should switch legs and repeat the forward/backward and side-to-side swings on the other side. Maintain good posture throughout the exercise.",
    "general instruction: The player should keep their core engaged and their back straight throughout the exercise. The movement should be fluid and dynamic, but not ballistic or jerky. Avoid twisting your torso. Focus on warming up the hip joint and the surrounding muscles. This is a dynamic stretching exercise, meaning the movement is continuous, unlike static stretches where you hold a position. If you feel any pain, reduce the range of motion or stop the exercise. Start slowly and gradually increase the swing height and number of repetitions."

    "action step 4: The player should slowly lower the leg back down to the starting position, maintaining control. Avoid letting the knee drop completely to the floor before the next repetition.",
    "action step 5: The player should repeat the movement for a designated number of repetitions (e.g., 10-15) on one leg, then switch to the other leg. Maintain good form throughout the exercise.",
    "general instruction: The player should keep their core engaged throughout the exercise to protect their lower back. Avoid arching your back; the movement should primarily come from the hip. Imagine pushing your heel directly upwards, not kicking backwards.  If you feel any pain in your lower back, stop the exercise.  Focus on controlled movements and engaging the glute muscles. You can increase the difficulty by adding ankle weights, but start without weights to master the form first. This is primarily a glute activation exercise and dynamic warm-up; don't expect a huge range of motion."

    "general instruction: The player should keep a slight bend in your knees if your hamstrings are tight; prioritize a straight spine over perfectly straight legs.  Imagine drawing your sitting bones up towards the ceiling.  Avoid locking your elbows.  If you feel any wrist pain, try distributing your weight more evenly across your hands, or slightly rotate your hands outwards.  This pose is both a stretch and a strengthening pose.  Breathe deeply and evenly throughout the pose, using it as a resting pose in your yoga flow."

This is an advanced pose; do not attempt it without proper preparation and, ideally, supervision from a qualified instructor, especially if you are new to inversions. Warm up thoroughly beforehand, focusing on wrists, shoulders, and core. If you feel any pain, especially in your wrists, lower back, or shoulders, come out of the pose immediately. Build up your strength gradually. Practice 'bailout' techniques (how to safely come out of the pose) before attempting to hold the handstand for extended periods. Focus on engaging your entire body, not just your arms. Consistent practice, even for short periods, is more beneficial than infrequent, long attempts."

    "action step 4: The player incorporates body movement, such as stepping, turning, and shifting weight, to enhance the flow and dynamism of the 舞花棍. These movements should complement the nunchaku movements, creating a unified performance.",
    "action step 5: The player practices catching the free handle and transitioning into different grips and 舞花 patterns. This allows for continuous flow and prevents the nunchaku from becoming static.",
    "general instruction: The player should start with basic 'flower' patterns, such as front swings and figure-eights, before progressing to more complex movements. Practice slowly and deliberately, focusing on smoothness, control, and avoiding hitting oneself. A soft practice nunchaku or wrapping a regular nunchaku in foam is highly recommended for beginners. Consistent practice and patience are key to mastering 舞花棍 safely and effectively."

  "Downward Staff Chop": [
    "action step 1: The player begins with a firm grip on one handle of the nunchaku, holding it either overhead or at shoulder level, prepared for a downward strike. The stance should be stable and balanced, allowing for power generation from the legs and core.",
    "action step 2: The player initiates the downward swing by extending the arm holding the nunchaku and rotating the body, generating momentum. This rotation should involve the hips and core, not just the arm, to maximize power.",
    "action step 3: The player brings the free handle of the nunchaku down in a vertical or slightly diagonal arc, aiming for the intended target. The wrist should be firm but not locked, allowing for a snapping motion at the point of impact.",
    "action step 4: The player makes contact with the target with the free handle of the nunchaku, focusing the force through the striking surface. It is critical *not* to fully extend the arm and lock the elbow, as this can cause injury.",
    "action step 5: The player immediately follows through with the motion, allowing the nunchaku to continue its natural arc after impact, or controls the rebound to prepare for the next movement. This follow-through helps maintain balance and control.",
    "general instruction: The player should start slowly and focus on proper form and technique before increasing speed or power. Practice with a soft target, such as a heavy bag or padded surface, to avoid injury. Pay close attention to body mechanics, using the legs and core to generate power, and avoid relying solely on arm strength. Always be mindful of the surroundings and ensure sufficient space to practice safely. Using a padded practice nunchaku is recommended, especially for beginners."
  ],
  "Sword Thrust": [
    "action step 1: The player begins in a balanced stance, often a bow stance (弓步) or a similar stance that allows for forward lunging and stability. The sword is held with a relaxed but firm grip, typically with the thumb and index finger controlling the direction of the blade.",
    "action step 2: The player initiates the thrust by extending the sword arm forward, keeping the blade aligned with the target. This extension should be smooth and controlled, originating from the core and extending through the shoulder and arm.",
    "action step 3: The player simultaneously steps forward with the front leg (if in a bow stance), adding power and reach to the thrust. This step should be coordinated with the arm extension, creating a unified movement.",
    "action step 4: The player focuses on maintaining a straight line from the back heel, through the hips and shoulders, to the tip of the sword. This alignment is crucial for maximizing power and accuracy.",
    "action step 5: The player completes the thrust with full extension of the arm and body, maintaining balance and control. The tip of the sword should be the point of contact, and the body should be prepared to recover or transition into the next movement.",
    "general instruction: The player should practice 刺剑 slowly and deliberately, focusing on proper form and alignment. Emphasize smoothness and control over speed and power. Visualize the sword as an extension of your arm and body, and strive for a unified, coordinated movement. It is crucial to maintain a relaxed grip and avoid tension in the shoulders and arms. Focus on precision and direct your energy toward the tip of the sword."
  ],
  "Sword Point": [
    "action step 1: The player begins in a balanced and agile stance, ready to move quickly and precisely. The sword is held with a relaxed grip, allowing for maximum wrist flexibility and control of the blade tip.",
    "action step 2: The player identifies the target and initiates a small, controlled step or shift in body weight towards it. This movement is subtle and quick, preparing for the rapid wrist action.",
    "action step 3: The player uses a quick, snapping motion of the wrist to flick the tip of the sword forward towards the target. The power comes primarily from the wrist and forearm, not a large arm movement.",
    "action step 4: The player makes contact with the target with the very tip of the sword, emphasizing precision and accuracy. The '点' (point) should be light and fast, like a dragonfly skimming the water.",
    "action step 5: The player immediately withdraws the sword tip after making contact, returning to a ready position. This quick retraction is crucial for defense and to prepare for subsequent movements.",
    "general instruction: The player should focus on developing wrist flexibility and control when practicing 点剑. Practice the snapping motion repeatedly, emphasizing speed and precision over power. Imagine the sword tip as an extension of your fingertip, targeting specific points with light, rapid taps. Start slow and gradually increase speed as control develops. Relaxation is key, avoid tension."
  ],
  "Tai Chi Sword Stir": [
    "action step 1: The player starts with a stable stance, often a bow stance (Gong Bu) or an empty stance (Xu Bu), with the sword held naturally, typically in a forward-pointing grip near the guard.  The body should be relaxed but upright, maintaining a centered and balanced posture. Ensure your weight is appropriately distributed for the upcoming movement.",
    "action step 2: The player initiates the upward movement (Liao) from the wrist and forearm, guiding the sword in a smooth, arcing path. The sword tip moves upward and forward, tracing a curve, almost like drawing a semi-circle in the air. The elbow should remain slightly bent and not overly extended.",
    "action step 3: The player keeps the blade's edge facing the direction of the arc, using the wrist to control the angle and precision of the movement.  The 'Liao' action is not a slash; it's a controlled lift, aiming to deflect or displace an opponent's weapon rather than cut. The power comes from the waist rotation, not just the arm.",
    "action step 4: The player coordinates the upward arc with a subtle shift in body weight and a slight rotation of the waist in the direction of the movement. This adds power and fluidity to the technique. Avoid leaning excessively or losing your balance during the motion.",
    "action step 5: The player completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position where it can either continue into another technique or return to a guard position. The final position will depend on the specific application and the next intended movement. The wrist remains flexible, ready for the transition.",
    "general instruction: The player should practice 'Liao Jian' slowly and deliberately at first, focusing on the smoothness and precision of the arc. Gradually increase speed as you develop better control and coordination. Remember to maintain a relaxed yet engaged posture, coordinating your breath with the movement (often exhaling during the upward arc). Visualize deflecting an opponent's weapon to help understand the practical application of the technique."
  ],
  "Sword Sweep": [
    "action step 1: The player begins in a stable stance, such as a bow stance (Gong Bu) or a horse stance (Ma Bu), with the sword held firmly but not rigidly. The body should be upright and centered, with weight evenly distributed or appropriately shifted for the intended direction of the sweep. Ensure your core is engaged to provide stability and power.",
    "action step 2: The player initiates the sweeping motion (Sao) primarily from the waist and hips, rotating the body in the direction of the sweep. The arm holding the sword extends outward, keeping the blade relatively horizontal and close to the ground (though the exact height depends on the specific application). Avoid initiating the movement solely with the arm; the power should originate from the core.",
    "action step 3: The player maintains a consistent blade angle throughout the sweep, typically keeping the edge leading the movement. The wrist should be firm but not locked, allowing for adjustments and maintaining control of the sword's path. Imagine clearing a space in front of you with the sword.",
    "action step 4: The player coordinates the body rotation and arm extension with a stepping motion, if necessary, to increase the reach and power of the sweep. The stepping should be smooth and controlled, maintaining balance throughout the movement. The non-sword hand often moves in a complementary way to maintain balance and add to the rotational force.",
    "action step 5: The player completes the sweep by bringing the sword to a controlled stop, either in a guard position or ready for the next movement. Avoid over-rotating or losing your balance at the end of the sweep. The final position should be stable and allow for a quick transition to another technique.",
    "general instruction: The player should practice 'Sao Jian' slowly at first, focusing on the coordination of the waist, hips, and arm. Pay attention to maintaining a smooth, horizontal arc with the sword. Gradually increase speed and power as you become more comfortable with the movement. Remember to breathe naturally, often exhaling during the sweeping motion. Visualize clearing obstacles or sweeping an opponent's legs to better understand the technique's purpose."
  ],
  "Cloud Sword": [
    "action step 1: The player starts from a balanced stance, often a neutral stance or a slightly shifted stance depending on the preceding movement. The sword is typically held in front of the body or to the side, ready to initiate the circular motion. Maintain a relaxed but upright posture, with the core engaged.",
    "action step 2: The player initiates the 'Cloud Sword' (Yun Jian) by moving the sword in a continuous, flowing, circular motion. The circles are typically horizontal or slightly angled, and can be performed in front of the body, to the sides, or overhead. The movement should be smooth and even, like clouds drifting in the sky.",
    "action step 3: The player uses the wrist and forearm to guide the sword through the circular paths, maintaining a consistent speed and rhythm. The elbow remains slightly bent and flexible, acting as a pivot point for the movement. Avoid jerky or abrupt changes in direction; the circles should blend seamlessly into one another.",
    "action step 4: The player coordinates the sword's circular motion with subtle body movements, including slight waist rotations and weight shifts. These movements enhance the fluidity and power of the technique, and help maintain balance. The non-sword hand often moves in a complementary way, mirroring the sword's motion or maintaining balance.",
    "action step 5: The player continues the 'Cloud Sword' for the desired number of repetitions or transitions smoothly into another technique. The circles can be large or small, and can change direction or plane. The key is to maintain the continuous, flowing quality of the movement throughout.",
    "general instruction: The player should practice 'Yun Jian' slowly at first, focusing on the smoothness and continuity of the circles. Imagine the sword moving like clouds, effortlessly and gracefully. Gradually increase speed and complexity as you develop better control and coordination. Remember to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing the breath to flow with the movement. Visualize deflecting multiple attacks or creating a defensive screen with the sword."
