The staff point action in this video is bad. The character starts with a poor stance, not demonstrating the correct grip on the staff and positioning it for a proper strike. The execution of the staff point lacks precision and control, with the staff being swung in an unbalanced manner. Additionally, there's no indication of the correct body position or the intended target for the strike. To improve, the character should start with a stable stance, practice proper grip and staff positioning, and focus on generating power from the ground through the arms to perform a precise and controlled staff point.
