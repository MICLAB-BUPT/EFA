The pull up action in this video is bad. Although the athlete achieves a full range of motion by bringing the chin over the bar, the technique is flawed due to excessive dynamic movement and a lack of control during the ascent. Specifically, the athlete fails to initiate the movement from a full, relaxed dead hang with straight arms, immediately demonstrating a slight bend in the elbows. More critically, the pronounced arching and hyperextension of the lower back (lumbar spine) during the pull indicates poor core engagement and reliance on momentum rather than strict muscle strength, which decreases muscular efficiency and increases the risk of lumbar strain. To correct this, the athlete must first ensure a full dead hang start; second, actively engage the core to maintain a neutral spine or a slight hollow body position throughout the entire repetition; and finally, focus on driving the elbows down and back to maximize lat recruitment without compensating with the lower back.
