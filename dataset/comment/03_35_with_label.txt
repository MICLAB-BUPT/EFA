The barbell upright row action in this video is bad. The most detrimental technical error is the athlete's excessively narrow grip, which severely limits external rotation and forces the shoulders into an internally rotated, impingement-prone position during the lift. Although the elbows are tracking high, the narrow hand position causes the pull to be too vertical and centrally focused, further compressing the shoulder joint. Additionally, the barbell is pulled slightly too high, reaching the clavicle level, which is unnecessary and increases injury risk. To correct this, the athlete must significantly widen their grip to at least shoulder-width or wider to facilitate a safer scapular plane movement. They should also reduce the peak height of the pull, stopping the bar at mid-chest level, and ensure a controlled descent, always keeping the elbows tracking high and slightly outward.
