The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character begins with an unstable stance and does not maintain proper core engagement throughout the movement. Additionally, the character's arm extends outwards without initiating the motion from the waist and hips, which compromises the power and control of the sweep. To improve, the character should begin in a stable stance, initiate the movement from the waist and hips, and ensure that the wrist remains firm but not locked while maintaining a consistent blade angle.
