The cross drape red action in this video is good. The character begins by holding the rope of the Liuxingchui with a secure grip, as described in the ideal steps. He initiates the 'Shi Zi' pattern by swinging the Liuxingchui in a cross-shaped motion, keeping the rope taut and controlling the momentum effectively. The transitions between vertical and horizontal swings are smooth and continuous, demonstrating precision and artistry. Throughout the performance, the character maintains a balanced posture and uses his entire body to control the movements of the Liuxingchui. The actions are fluid and well-coordinated, resulting in an impressive display of skill and technique.
