The spinning whip action in this video is bad. The person's stance and positioning are not ideal for executing a proper spin, leading to a less controlled movement. To improve, the individual should start with a stable stance, holding the whip handle firmly while extending the chain. They should initiate the spin by turning their body and swinging the whip in a controlled manner, focusing on balance and precision throughout the motion.
