The spear point action in this video is good. The person starts with a balanced stance and maintains focus on the target throughout the movement. They execute the quick, controlled step towards the target effectively, ensuring the spear tip strikes precisely where intended. After making contact, they retract the spear quickly and return to a ready position. The precision of the movement and the control displayed are indicative of a well-practiced technique.
