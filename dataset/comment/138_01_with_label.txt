The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The character starts with a stable stance, maintaining a centered and balanced posture. The upward movement is initiated from the wrist and forearm, guiding the sword in a smooth, arcing path. The blade's edge faces the direction of the arc, using the wrist to control the angle and precision of the movement. The power comes from the waist rotation, not just the arm. The character completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position where it can continue into another technique or return to a guard position. The wrist remains flexible, ready for the transition.
