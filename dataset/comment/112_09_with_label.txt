The staff point action in this video is good. The individual maintains a firm grip on the staff and starts from a stable stance, preparing for the 'Dian' (pointing) action. They execute the pointing movement with precision and control, using their body to generate power and transfer it through the arms. The thrust is short and sharp, and the retraction of the staff is quick and controlled, maintaining balance throughout the technique. Overall, the performance demonstrates good form and skill in handling the staff.
