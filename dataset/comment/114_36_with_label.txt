The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is bad. The character begins in a stable stance, but the hand positioning is not ideal for the intended starting point of the 'Ti Liao'. The body does not coil slightly to generate upward power. The lifting motion is not combined with a forward or diagonal movement, creating an upward and outward scooping or raising action. The wrist and forearm do not work together to flick the tip of the staff upwards and outwards towards a target at head or chest level. The power is not generated from the legs and core, transferred through the lifting motion, and amplified by the wrist flick. To improve, the character should start with proper hand positioning, coil the body to generate upward power, combine the lifting motion with a forward or diagonal movement, and ensure that the wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff upwards and outwards towards a target.
