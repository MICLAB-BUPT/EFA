The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by lying on the floor with knees bent and feet flat, positioning the barbell across the hips, and engaging their core during the exercise. They maintain a straight line from shoulders to knees while squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the ground, ensuring full hip extension without excessive lower back hyperextension. The person holds the bridge position briefly at the top before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control, avoiding rapid or forceful movements.
