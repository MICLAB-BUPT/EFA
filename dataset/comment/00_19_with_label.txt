The pull up action in this video is good. The person grips the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and begins from a dead hang. They initiate the pull by engaging their back and shoulder muscles, pulling their shoulder blades down and back, and continue pulling until their chin is above the bar. The person maintains a neutral head position throughout the movement and then slowly lowers back down to the starting dead hang position with full control.
