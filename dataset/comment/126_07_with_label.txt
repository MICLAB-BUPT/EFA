The staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, providing a solid foundation for the powerful downward strike. They prepare for the 'Pi' (chopping or splitting) action by raising the Nangun above their head, positioning it for a downward strike. The body coils slightly, storing potential energy. The character then initiates the 'Pi Gun' (downward striking motion), bringing the Nangun from a high position to a lower position with force and precision. The movement is vertical, generating power from the ground through the legs and core, transferred through the arms to the staff. The non-wielding hand moves for balance and contributes to the downward momentum. The character completes the 'Pi', bringing the Nangun to a lower position near the waist or thigh, ready to transition to the next movement.
