The barbell upright row action in this video is bad. The primary issue is the athlete's grip width, which is too narrow, forcing excessive internal rotation of the shoulder joint during the lift. This narrow grip, coupled with pulling the barbell past the level of the clavicles, significantly increases the risk of shoulder impingement, as it pinches the soft tissues within the subacromial space. While the elbows are higher than the wrists, the cumulative effect of the extremely narrow grip and high pull trajectory places the shoulder in a mechanically vulnerable position. To execute this exercise safely and effectively, the athlete should widen their grip (at least shoulder-width or slightly wider), reduce the height of the pull so the barbell stops around mid-chest level, and focus on keeping the elbows pointed outwards and higher than the wrists throughout the movement to target the medial deltoids without compromising shoulder integrity.
