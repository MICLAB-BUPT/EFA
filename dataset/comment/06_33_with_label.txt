The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine and slightly straighter legs than a conventional deadlift setup, which is an important aspect of the exercise. They also keep their back straight and engage their abdominal muscles while maintaining tension in the hamstrings, ensuring proper form. The bar is held close to the legs, minimizing unnecessary strain on the lower back. However, there is room for improvement as the person could maintain a more upright posture and drive through the heels more effectively during the lift. By refining these aspects, the individual can further enhance their technique and reduce the risk of injury.
