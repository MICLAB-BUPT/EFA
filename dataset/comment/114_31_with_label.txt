The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is bad because the person does not begin in a stable stance, such as a horse stance ( ma bu  mǎ bù), bow stance ( gong bu  gōng bù), or a neutral stance. Instead, they start with an incorrect posture, which can lead to poor technique and difficulty in executing the movements effectively. To improve, the person should ensure they are in a balanced position before initiating any staff work, allowing for better control and precision during the lifting and sweeping motions.
