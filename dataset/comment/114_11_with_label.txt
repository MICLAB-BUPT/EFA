The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the staff with a firm grip, which is essential for maintaining balance and control during the technique. The body coiling slightly indicates preparation to generate upward power. The lifting motion of the staff upwards is executed smoothly, combining forward and diagonal movements to create an upward and outward scooping or raising action. The wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff upwards and outwards, generating power from the legs and core. The transition into another technique after retracting the staff to a guard position demonstrates skillful execution. Overall, the actions are fluid, controlled, and well-coordinated, showcasing the character's proficiency in handling the staff.
