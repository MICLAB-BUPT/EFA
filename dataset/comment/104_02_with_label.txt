The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The character maintains a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ), with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. The knees are deeply bent, thighs are parallel to the ground, back is straight, and core is engaged, which is ideal for stability and power generation. The character's hands are positioned correctly, one hand performing the 'Lou Shou' ( lou shou , scooping/raking hand) with a sweeping motion, starting from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards, or from a lower position moving outwards and upwards, often in a circular or semi-circular path. The palm is open, and the movement is controlled and fluid. The specific trajectory and target of the 'Lou Shou' are consistent with the intended application, such as defense or grabbing. The character maintains the 'Ma Bu' throughout the movement, providing stability and power. Overall, the character's execution of the horse stance gather hand technique is precise and well-executed, making it a good demonstration of the form.
