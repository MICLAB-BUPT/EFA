The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back and neutral spine, which are crucial for proper form and reducing the risk of injury. They also keep their core engaged and maintain tension in their hamstrings, ensuring stability throughout the movement. The person's grip on the bar is appropriate, with a slightly wider stance than shoulder-width, allowing for better control and balance during the lift. Overall, the execution of the exercise is well-controlled and demonstrates a solid understanding of the technique.
