The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The individual maintains a stable stance with feet shoulder-width apart and holds the barbell with an underhand grip, keeping the elbows close to the torso and wrists straight. They engage their core by taking a breath and brace before performing the curl. The focus on squeezing the biceps at the top of the movement is also noteworthy. However, there is room for improvement as the person could maintain a more controlled lowering phase to ensure better control and stability throughout the exercise.
