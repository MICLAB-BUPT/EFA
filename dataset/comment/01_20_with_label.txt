The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form throughout the exercise, starting with a wide grip on the barbell, which helps distribute the load evenly across the shoulders. They also demonstrate correct positioning by keeping their elbows at a 45-75 degree angle to their body, avoiding flaring them out completely or tucking them in tightly. Additionally, the person exhibits controlled movement during both the descent and ascent of the barbell, ensuring that they are primarily using their chest muscles for the exercise. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the mechanics involved in the bench press and suggests that the individual has a solid technique.
