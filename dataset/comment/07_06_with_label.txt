The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine, keeping the chest up and the hips level throughout the movement. They initiate the squat by bending at the hips and knees, descending to a depth where the hip crease is below the top of the knee. The person then drives through the heels to return to the starting position, maintaining proper form throughout the exercise. This demonstrates a controlled and effective execution of the back squat.
