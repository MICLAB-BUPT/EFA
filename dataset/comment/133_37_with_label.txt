The spear flourish action in this video is bad. The person has poor control over the spear, causing it to swing wildly and unsteadily. The movements are not fluid or continuous, and there is a lack of precision in the patterns being traced by the spear. The stance is also not balanced or agile enough, leading to a less dynamic performance. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a firm grip on the spear, practicing smoother transitions between movements, and incorporating more complex techniques for a more refined display.
