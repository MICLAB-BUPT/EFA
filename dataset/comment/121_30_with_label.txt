The rope slide action in this video is bad. The character starts with a grip that is too tight, causing the rope to be held too close to the body. This results in limited control and movement of the rope during the slide. To improve, the character should practice maintaining a secure but loose grip on the rope, allowing it to slide through the hand more freely while still controlling its length and tension.
