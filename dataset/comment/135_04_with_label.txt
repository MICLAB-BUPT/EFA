The downward staff chop action in this video is good. The individual maintains a firm grip on the nunchaku and starts with the weapon held overhead or at shoulder level, preparing for the strike. They initiate the downward swing by extending their arm and rotating their body, generating momentum through their hips and core. The free handle of the nunchaku is brought down in a vertical or slightly diagonal arc, aiming for the intended target. The wrist remains firm but not locked, allowing for a snapping motion at the point of impact. The follow-through after impact is smooth, maintaining balance and control. The execution of these steps indicates a well-practiced and controlled downward staff chop technique.
