The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad because the individual's elbows are not close to the torso, which can lead to poor muscle engagement and increased risk of injury. Additionally, the person's wrists appear to be flexed inward, which might not provide optimal support for the exercise. To improve this, the individual should focus on keeping their elbows close to their body and ensuring that their wrists remain neutral or slightly flexed throughout the movement.
