The shifting weight onto one leg and stepping diagonally forward are executed smoothly, maintaining proper form. The ward-off and pushing motions with the arms are performed with precision, ensuring a fluid transition between movements. The bow stance is well-executed, with the front knee bent and the back leg extended, creating a clear diagonal line of force. The alternating movement on the opposite side is also executed with precision, demonstrating a refined technique. Overall, the character maintains a consistent rhythm and form throughout the sequence, showcasing skillful execution of the Tai Chi form.
