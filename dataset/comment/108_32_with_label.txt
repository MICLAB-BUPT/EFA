The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a secure and controlled grip on the broadsword, which is an essential aspect of the Dao form. Additionally, the movement lacks fluidity and coordination, with the body's core strength and weight shifting being insufficiently utilized. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a secure grip, executing the drop step and drawing motion with more fluidity, and using proper body mechanics to generate power.
