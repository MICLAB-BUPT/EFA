The pull up action in this video is good. The individual maintains a controlled movement throughout the exercise, demonstrating proper technique. They start from a dead hang position with arms fully extended and shoulders relaxed. As they pull themselves up, their back and shoulder muscles engage, and they maintain a neutral head position. The chin rises above the bar before slowly lowering back down to the starting position. This controlled motion ensures that the exercise is performed safely and effectively, without unnecessary swinging or kipping.
