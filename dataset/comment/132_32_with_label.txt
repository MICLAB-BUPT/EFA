The block, seize, thrust action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a proper stance throughout the sequence. The initial stance is not clearly defined, which can affect balance and control during the techniques. Additionally, there is no clear indication of the blocking motion being firm and controlled, as described in the ideal action steps. Lastly, the transition between the block and the thrust appears to be abrupt, without a smooth flow that would allow for effective control and execution of the technique.
