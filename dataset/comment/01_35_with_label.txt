The barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The initial lift-off is poor, with the elbows excessively tucked and positioned directly over the shoulders, which forces the weight onto the triceps and shoulders rather than the chest, increasing joint stress. To correct this, the individual must un-rack the bar with the elbows slightly flared (45-75 degrees) to engage the pectoral muscles immediately and maintain stability. Furthermore, the descent lacks control, evidenced by the quick, almost uncontrolled drop to the chest, compromising muscle time-under-tension and form integrity. The corrective action involves consciously slowing the eccentric phase (3-4 seconds) to maximize muscle fiber recruitment and ensure the bar path terminates at the mid-to-lower chest. Finally, the ascent is also uncontrolled and appears rushed, which minimizes power output and stabilization. The individual must focus on a powerful, controlled concentric push while maintaining a stable back and foot drive to finish the rep strongly and safely.
