The sword thrust action in this video is good. The character begins in a balanced stance, which allows for forward lunging and stability. The sword is held with a relaxed but firm grip, typically with the thumb and index finger controlling the direction of the blade. The player initiates the thrust by extending the sword arm forward, keeping the blade aligned with the target. This extension is smooth and controlled, originating from the core and extending through the shoulder and arm. The player simultaneously steps forward with the front leg, adding power and reach to the thrust. This step is coordinated with the arm extension, creating a unified movement. The player maintains a straight line from the back heel, through the hips and shoulders, to the tip of the sword, which is crucial for maximizing power and accuracy. The character completes the thrust with full extension of the arm and body, maintaining balance and control. The tip of the sword is the point of contact, and the body is prepared to recover or transition into the next movement.
