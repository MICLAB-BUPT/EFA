The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The person demonstrates proper form and technique, starting with the barbell positioned across their upper back, standing with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and initiating the squat by bending at the hips and knees while maintaining a neutral spine and keeping the chest up. They descend to a depth that allows for good form and then drive through the heels to return to the starting position.
