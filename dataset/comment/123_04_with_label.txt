The back flourish action in this video is good. The character maintains a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao and positions it for the 'Bei Hua' technique, which involves moving the sword behind their back. The circular or figure-eight motion is executed smoothly, with the blade under control throughout the movement. The non-wielding hand also moves in a coordinated manner for balance. The transition into another technique or return to a ready stance is done fluidly. These aspects classify the action as 'good' because they demonstrate proper form and technique, maintaining control and precision during the back flourish.
