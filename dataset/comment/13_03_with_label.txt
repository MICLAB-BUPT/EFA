The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual begins by lying face up on the bench, holding dumbbells with palms facing each other and extending the arms straight up above the chest, which is a proper starting position for this exercise. The upper arms are kept stationary throughout the movement, adhering to the ideal form where only the elbow joint bends during the exercise. The person maintains control of the dumbbells while slowly lowering them towards the forehead and then extends them back to the starting position, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement. This controlled motion helps to engage the triceps effectively. The person also exhales during the upward push, which is a good technique to avoid excessive arching of the lower back and maintain stability. Overall, the actions executed in the video are in line with the ideal standards for performing a laying dumbbell triceps extension, making it an effective and well-executed exercise demonstration.
