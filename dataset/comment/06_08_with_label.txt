The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine and proper form throughout the lift, demonstrating control and technique. The stance with feet hip-width apart and slightly bending the knees allows for stability and prevents strain on the lower back. The grip is wide enough to ensure the barbell remains close to the body, minimizing unnecessary movement. The person also braces their core, which helps maintain balance and prevents unnecessary movement during the lift. Overall, the actions shown in the video are executed correctly, making it an effective demonstration of a barbell stiff-leg deadlift.
