The horse stance punch action in this video is bad. The character starts with a solid 'Ma Bu' (horse stance), but the feet are not positioned significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, and the toes do not point forward or slightly outward. The knees are not deeply bent, and the thighs are not parallel to the ground. The character's hand positioning is also suboptimal; one hand is not chambered at the waist in a fist, and the other hand does not maintain a guard position. Additionally, the character does not initiate the 'Chong Quan' (thrusting punch) from the ground, with proper rotation of the waist. The character extends the punching arm forward without maintaining the 'Ma Bu' throughout the punch, leading to instability and imbalance. To improve, the character should ensure that their feet are positioned correctly, the knees are deeply bent, and the hand positioning is accurate. They should also focus on generating power from the ground and maintaining balance throughout the punch.
