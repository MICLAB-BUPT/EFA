The pull up action in this video is good. The person starts from a dead hang, grips the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and initiates the pull by engaging their back and shoulder muscles. The movement is controlled as they pull themselves up until their chin is above the bar, demonstrating proper technique.
