The sword sweep action in this video is good. The individual maintains a stable stance and initiates the sweeping motion from the waist and hips, keeping the blade relatively horizontal and close to the ground. The arm holding the sword extends outward, with the wrist remaining firm but not locked, allowing for adjustments and maintaining control of the sword's path. The stepping motion is smooth and controlled, aiding in increasing reach and power. The person completes the sweep by bringing the sword to a controlled stop, ensuring stability and readiness for the next movement.
