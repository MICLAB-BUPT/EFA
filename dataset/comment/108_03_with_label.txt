The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a clear and controlled execution of the 'Pu Bu' (drop step) by lowering their body and shifting weight onto one leg while extending the other. This movement is fundamental to maintaining balance and momentum during the form. Additionally, the 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action with the Dao) is performed with fluidity and coordination, indicating an understanding of the technique's importance in generating power for the subsequent movements. The character's stance remains stable throughout, allowing for a smooth transition into the next action. Overall, the character's performance aligns well with the ideal standards for executing the pounce step carrying knife action.
