The spear twist action in this video is bad because the player's grip on the spear is not firm but adaptable, and there is no control or pressure applied during the twisting motion. The contact point with the opponent's weapon is not closer to the player's hands, which would provide better leverage. The twisting motion is executed without a combination of wrist, arm, and body rotation, resulting in a jerky movement that compromises balance and control. The force applied during the twisting motion is not smooth and deliberate, further diminishing the effectiveness of the technique. To improve, the player should maintain a firm grip with adaptability, apply constant pressure and control, ensure the contact point is closer to their hands, and execute the twisting motion with proper body rotation for maximum leverage and stability.
