The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person maintains a proper form by lying on the inclined bench with their feet flat on the floor, gripping the barbell with a full grip, and keeping their elbows tucked in while lowering the barbell to the chest. They also extend their arms back up to the starting position, maintaining core engagement throughout the exercise.
