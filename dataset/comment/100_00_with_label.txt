The cloud hands action in this video is good. The person begins in a neutral stance and shifts their weight from one leg to the other while maintaining a side-to-side movement, which is consistent with the ideal steps for Tai Chi. Their hands move in a coordinated, circular motion, as if waving clouds, passing each other without crossing directly, demonstrating precision and flow. The continuous, flowing sequence of movements is executed with a focus on the waist, aligning with the ideal standards. The person repeats the 'Yun Shou' (Cloud Hands) movement multiple times, showing a clear understanding of the form. Overall, the actions are well-coordinated, precise, and follow the principles of Tai Chi, making it an exemplary performance.
