The bow stance punch action in this video is good. The person begins in a preparatory stance with feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, ensuring an even weight distribution. They transition into the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) by stepping forward with one leg, bending the front knee to approximately 90 degrees while keeping the back leg straight. The torso remains upright, and the front knee is aligned over the ankle. As the person initiates the punch, they use the rotation of their body to generate power, and the punch originates from the waist. The fist is extended forward, aiming for the target, and the non-punching hand retracts to the waist or remains in a guard position. The person maintains balance and control throughout the movement, demonstrating proper technique.
