The barbell deadlift action in this video is bad. The person is not approaching the barbell with their feet hip-width apart, which can lead to poor balance and control during the lift. Additionally, they are not gripping the bar just outside the legs with an overhand or mixed grip, which can cause strain on the wrists and increase the risk of injury. The person also does not take a deep breath and brace the core before initiating the lift, which can result in a lack of stability and control throughout the movement. To improve their form, the person should focus on proper foot positioning, grip, breathing technique, and core engagement to ensure a safe and effective deadlift.
