The cloud hands action in this video is good. The person begins from a neutral stance and maintains relaxed, centered body posture throughout the sequence. The weight shifts smoothly from one leg to the other as they initiate side-to-side movements, with the body turning slightly in the direction of the weight transfer. The hands move in a coordinated, circular motion, passing each other without crossing directly, which showcases fluidity and control. The continuous flow of movement, driven by the waist, is evident as the person repeats the 'Yun Shou' (Cloud Hands) movement multiple times. Overall, the actions are executed with precision and grace, demonstrating an excellent understanding of Tai Chi principles.
