The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The practitioner demonstrates a stable stance and maintains a balanced posture throughout the sequence, with the sword held naturally and the body relaxed but upright. The upward movement is initiated smoothly from the wrist and forearm, with the sword tip tracing a curved path in the air. The blade's edge faces the direction of the arc, and the wrist controls the angle and precision of the movement. The waist rotation adds power and fluidity to the technique, without excessive leaning or loss of balance. Finally, the practitioner completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position ready for the next intended movement, showcasing flexibility and preparedness for further actions.
