The left and right shuttle action in this video is bad. The character does not begin from a preceding posture, which is crucial for proper form and energy flow in Tai Chi. Additionally, the character's weight shifting onto one leg is not done with precision, as it should be more focused on the balance between both legs. The stepping motion is also not executed correctly, as it lacks the diagonal forward and outward movement that creates a bow stance. Furthermore, the arm movements are not properly coordinated with the stepping, resulting in a lack of fluidity and power in the ward-off and push motions. To improve, the character should focus on starting from a balanced position, ensuring precise weight shifts, and practicing coordinated arm movements to achieve a more authentic Tai Chi experience.
