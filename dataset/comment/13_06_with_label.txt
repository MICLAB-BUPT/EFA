The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The person starts by lying face up on a flat bench, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other, which is the correct initial position. They then proceed to extend their arms straight up above the chest while keeping a slight bend in the elbows, maintaining proper form and avoiding locking out the elbows. The individual keeps the upper arms stationary throughout the exercise, focusing only on the elbow movement as per the ideal action steps. Additionally, they take a breath and brace the core, ensuring a stable torso on the bench and avoiding excessive arching of the lower back. The person lowers the dumbbells towards the forehead or slightly behind the head, demonstrating control and maintaining a perpendicular position of the upper arms to the floor. Finally, they extend their arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement, and exhale during the upward push. Overall, the execution of the laying dumbbell triceps extension in this video is well-executed, following the ideal action steps and demonstrating good form.
