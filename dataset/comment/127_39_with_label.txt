The staff throw action in this video is bad. The person starts with a firm grip on the staff, but the stance is not stable and the feet are not shoulder-width apart. This compromises the power generation needed for an effective throw. Additionally, the person's arms are not acting as levers to guide and amplify the force; instead, they seem to be the primary source of power. There is no precise timing or coordination in the release of the staff, and the follow-through is not smooth, which affects balance and injury prevention. To improve, the person should focus on a stable stance, using their core for power generation, and releasing the staff at the right moment while maintaining proper form throughout the throw.
