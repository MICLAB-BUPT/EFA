The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The person begins by assuming a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ) with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, knees deeply bent, and back straight. They position their hands, with one hand performing the 'Lou Shou' ( lou shou , scooping/raking hand) motion starting from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards, or from a lower position moving outwards and upwards. The arm is relaxed but firm, and the movement is controlled and fluid, maintaining the 'Ma Bu' throughout the technique. The execution of the 'Lou Shou' using the power generated from the 'Ma Bu' and the rotation of the waist is also well done. Overall, the person maintains a strong foundation and demonstrates good form during the horse stance gather hand technique.
