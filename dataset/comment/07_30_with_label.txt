The barbell back squat action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits a pronounced early forward lean and excessive knee travel over the toes during the descent, indicating poor hip drive and potentially compromised ankle mobility. This shifts the load heavily onto the knees and anterior chain, instead of evenly distributing it across the hips and posterior chain. Additionally, the athlete experiences a significant "butt wink" (posterior pelvic tilt leading to lumbar rounding) at the bottom of the squat, which places the lower back at risk under load. To improve, the athlete must initiate the squat by driving the hips back and down, maintaining a more upright torso (without undue forward lean), and ensure the lumbar spine remains neutral throughout the full depth of the squat. They should also focus on maintaining a consistent center of gravity over the mid-foot.
