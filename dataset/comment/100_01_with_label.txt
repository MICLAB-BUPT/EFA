The cloud hands action in this video is good. The person maintains a neutral stance and transitions smoothly from one leg to the other, initiating a side-to-side movement with fluidity. Their hands move in a coordinated, circular motion, passing each other without crossing directly, which is an ideal execution of the technique. The continuous, flowing sequence and the use of the waist are evident, showcasing the proper form for this Tai Chi movement. Overall, the performer demonstrates a well-executed and refined cloud hands technique.
