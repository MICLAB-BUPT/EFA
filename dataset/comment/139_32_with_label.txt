The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character does not begin in a stable stance, as the body is not upright and centered with weight evenly distributed. The initiation of the sweeping motion is not from the waist and hips, but rather the arm is initiating the movement solely. There is no consistent blade angle maintained throughout the sweep, and the wrist is locked, which can lead to loss of control. The stepping motion is not smooth and controlled, indicating instability. To improve, the character should start in a stable stance, initiate the sweep from the waist and hips, maintain a consistent blade angle, and coordinate the movements smoothly.
