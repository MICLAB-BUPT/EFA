The sword stir action in this video is bad. The person does not maintain a stable stance, and the grip on the sword is not firm or relaxed. The execution of the 'Liao' action is not diagonal, and the movement appears to be more horizontal than upward. Additionally, the wrist and forearm are not being used effectively to control the sword's arc and angle. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a stable stance, ensuring a proper grip on the sword, and performing the 'Liao' action with a diagonal movement from a low position.
