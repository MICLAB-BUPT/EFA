The pull up action in this video is good. The person grips the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, which is ideal for providing a strong and stable base for the exercise. The individual starts from a dead hang, ensuring their feet are hanging freely without touching the ground, demonstrating proper form. The movement is controlled throughout the exercise, with the person engaging their back and shoulder muscles to pull their chin above the bar. There is no swinging or kipping, emphasizing the importance of maintaining control and stability during the exercise.
