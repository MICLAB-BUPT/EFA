The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains a consistent grip width, starts with the barbell positioned directly over their chest, and exhibits proper control during the descent. They also push the barbell back up to the starting position with a steady pressing motion. To further refine their technique, they could work on ensuring their elbows are at a 45-75 degree angle to their body and avoid any violent lockout of the elbows.
