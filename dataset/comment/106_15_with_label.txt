The bow stance head wrap action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance with the Dao held in one hand, showcasing a firm yet relaxed grip. The transition into the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) is executed correctly, with one leg stepping forward and bending to approximately 90 degrees while maintaining balance on the back leg. Simultaneously, the 'Chan Tou' (head-wrapping action) is initiated with a circular or figure-eight motion of the Dao around the head, keeping it close to the head without making contact. The fluidity and control of the movement are evident, driven by the wrist, forearm, and body rotation. The other hand assists in controlling the Dao's momentum. The completion of the 'Chan Tou' brings the Dao to a finishing position, and the 'Gong Bu' is maintained throughout. This sequence demonstrates a well-executed bow stance head wrap technique.
