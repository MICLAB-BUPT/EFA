The barbell back squat action in this video is classified as 'good'. The individual demonstrates proper form and technique throughout the exercise. He starts with a wide stance, keeping his toes pointed outward for stability. He maintains a neutral spine while bending at the hips and knees, descending until the hip crease is below the knee or to a comfortable depth. His chest remains up, and he braces his core during the descent. Upon reaching the bottom of the squat, he drives through his heels to extend his hips and knees simultaneously, returning to the starting position. The video shows consistent back angle throughout the ascent, and the individual completes the exercise without any apparent deviations from ideal standards.
