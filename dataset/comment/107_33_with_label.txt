The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad because the character does not transition smoothly from a preparatory stance to the 'Gong Bu' or maintain proper form throughout the movement. The arm holding the sword is extended at an awkward angle, and there is a lack of power and precision in the thrust. To improve, the character should practice transitioning into the 'Gong Bu' with fluidity and control, ensure the arm extends properly, and maintain a balanced posture during the thrust.
