The scissor flourish action in this video is bad because the person is not maintaining a stable and balanced posture. The ideal stance for performing a scissor flourish involves a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao, with a stable and balanced posture. In this video, the person appears to be leaning forward and not keeping their body upright, which could affect their ability to control the blade and execute the crossing movements accurately. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining proper form by standing upright and ensuring that their grip on the Nandao is firm but relaxed.
