The knife flourish action in this video is bad. The person does not maintain a firm yet relaxed grip on the sword, and the stance appears to be unstable. Additionally, the motion of the sword is not controlled or circular as it should be. To improve, the person should focus on creating clear, distinct patterns with the blade while maintaining control and balance throughout the motion.
