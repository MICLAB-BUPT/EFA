Their stance is balanced and agile, allowing for free movement and rotation of the spear. The person initiates the 'flower' movements using their wrists, arms, and body to create circular or figure-eight patterns with the spear, demonstrating fluid and continuous movements that blend seamlessly into one another. They maintain control of the spear throughout the movements, keeping it close to the body and avoiding wild, uncontrolled swings. The person incorporates body movement such as stepping, turning, and shifting weight to enhance the flow and dynamism of the 'flower' movements. The actions are executed with precision and grace, tracing clear patterns in the air.
