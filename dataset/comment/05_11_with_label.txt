The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual lies face up on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. They position the barbell across the hips, resting it in the hip crease, which is a proper setup for the exercise. The hands are placed on the barbell to stabilize it, ensuring a secure grip. The person takes a deep breath and braces the core, engaging the abdominal muscles, which is essential for maintaining stability during the lift. They drive through the heels, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. The individual holds the bridge position for a brief pause at the top, maintaining glute engagement, and then slowly lowers the hips back down to the floor with control. These actions demonstrate good form and technique for performing a barbell glute bridge.
