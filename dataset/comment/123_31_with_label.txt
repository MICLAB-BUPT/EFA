The back flourish action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao throughout the video, as seen in the first frame. This can lead to a lack of control and precision in the movements. Additionally, the execution of the circular or figure-eight motion behind the back is not fluid and continuous, which is a deviation from the ideal standards for this technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a steady grip and performing the motion with fluidity and control.
