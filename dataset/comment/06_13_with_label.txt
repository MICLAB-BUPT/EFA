The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is bad. The most critical error is the athlete's failure to maintain a neutral spine, evidenced by significant lumbar rounding at the bottom of the movement. The athlete is prioritizing depth by sacrificing spinal integrity, which places the lower back at high risk. Furthermore, the final lockout involves a noticeable overextension (hyperextension) of the lumbar spine, unnecessarily compressing the vertebral joints at the top of the lift. The descent is also not perfectly controlled, with the bar momentarily floating slightly away from the legs. To correct this, the athlete must tightly brace the core and maintain a flat, neutral spine throughout the entire lift, only descending as far as mobility allows without rounding the back. The lockout should be achieved by standing tall with glutes squeezed, stopping the motion when the torso is vertical, avoiding any backward lean.
