The barbell front squat action in this video is bad. The man's form deviates from the ideal standards in several ways. Firstly, his stance is not optimal; he appears to be standing with his feet too wide apart and his toes pointing inward, which can lead to imbalance and difficulty in performing the exercise correctly. Secondly, his core is not braced properly, as indicated by the lack of visible tension in his abdomen, which could result in poor stability and control during the squat. Lastly, his descent into the squat does not seem controlled or smooth, potentially due to a lack of proper weight distribution or improper alignment of the knees and hips. To improve, the man should adjust his stance to be slightly narrower than shoulder-width with toes pointed outward, brace his core more effectively, and ensure a controlled descent while keeping his back straight and his core engaged throughout the movement.
