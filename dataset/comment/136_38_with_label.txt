The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character's form starts with a less-than-ideal stance, which could affect balance and power during the thrust. There is also a lack of fluidity in the movement as the character does not maintain a consistent line from the feet to the tip of the sword. Additionally, the execution of the thrust lacks proper extension and control, resulting in an unbalanced posture. To improve, the character should work on establishing a solid stance, ensuring that the thrust is initiated smoothly from the core, and maintaining a straight line through the body. Proper extension and control are essential for achieving a powerful and accurate thrust.
