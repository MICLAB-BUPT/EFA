The pull up action in this video is good. The individual starts from a dead hang, grips the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and initiates the pull by engaging their back and shoulder muscles. They continue pulling until their chin is above the bar, demonstrating proper form and technique. The movement is controlled throughout, and there's no swinging or kipping. This indicates that the individual has a strong foundation in pull-ups and is performing the exercise correctly.
