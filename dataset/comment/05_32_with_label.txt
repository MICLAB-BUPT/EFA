The barbell glute bridge action in this video is bad. The most apparent fault is the excessive forward pelvic tilt and hyperextension of the lumbar spine at the top of the movement, which is clearly visible as the lower back arches dramatically instead of the hips fully locking out via glute contraction. This overextension places the stress on the lower back, negating the intended glute work. Additionally, the athlete is using a resistance band wrapped around a bar (or similar implement), which is positioned too high on the abdomen rather than directly over the hip crease, reducing the effectiveness of the load. To correct this, the athlete must focus on achieving a posterior pelvic tilt before and during the lift, consciously tucking the tailbone, bracing the core, and stopping the movement immediately when the torso and thighs form a straight line, ensuring the glutes, not the lower back, initiate and complete the lift.
