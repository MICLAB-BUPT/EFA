The sword stir action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance and grip on the Jian, preparing for the 'Liao' action with a low positioning of the sword. The execution of the 'Liao' involves upward cutting or raising, using the power from the ground through the arm to the blade. The wrist and forearm play a crucial role in controlling the arc and angle of the cut, and the non-wielding hand assists in balancing and controlling the momentum. The finishing position of the sword is near the head or shoulder level, indicating proper technique.
