The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back and engaged core, which are crucial for proper form and injury prevention. They keep the bar close to their body, ensuring it doesn't swing excessively, and maintain control throughout the lift. While the bar reaches chest level or slightly below, it's done without excessive shoulder stress. However, there is room for improvement as the individual could continue to pull the bar higher while keeping the elbows higher than the wrists, which would further engage the muscles and reduce the strain on the shoulders.
