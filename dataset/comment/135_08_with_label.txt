The downward staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins with a firm grip on one handle of the nunchaku, holding it either overhead or at shoulder level, prepared for a downward strike. The stance is stable and balanced, allowing for power generation from the legs and core. The player initiates the downward swing by extending the arm holding the nunchaku and rotating the body, generating momentum. This rotation involves the hips and core, not just the arm, to maximize power. The player brings the free handle of the nunchaku down in a vertical or slightly diagonal arc, aiming for the intended target. The wrist is firm but not locked, allowing for a snapping motion at the point of impact. The player makes contact with the target with the free handle of the nunchaku, focusing the force through the striking surface. It is critical not to fully extend the arm and lock the elbow, as this can cause injury. The player immediately follows through with the motion, allowing the nunchaku to continue its natural arc after impact, or controls the rebound to prepare for the next movement. This follow-through helps maintain balance and control.
