The rope slide action in this video is bad. The character starts by holding the rope of the Liuxingchui with a secure grip, but there is no clear indication of how to properly initiate the "Liu Sheng" action. Additionally, the character does not demonstrate control over the amount of rope being released and does not show any progression in speed or complexity. To improve, the character should practice the "Liu Sheng" in various contexts, gradually increasing the speed and complexity of movements as proficiency improves.
