The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The person starts with their feet shoulder-width apart, holding the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width. Their knees are slightly bent, and their back is straight. They hinge at the hips, pushing their hips back, and lowering their torso until it's almost parallel to the floor, maintaining a straight back and neutral head position. The barbell is let hang straight down from their shoulders with arms fully extended. The person then pulls the barbell up towards their lower chest or upper abdomen, keeping their elbows close to their body, focusing on squeezing their shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. Finally, they slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent. There are no major refinements needed for this performance as it closely follows the ideal action steps provided.
