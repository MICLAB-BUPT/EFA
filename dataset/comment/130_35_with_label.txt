The spear point action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and controlled, which can lead to less accuracy and power when striking the target. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a balanced stance with a firm grip on the spear. The step towards the target should be quick and precise, and the extension of the spear arm should be executed with a flicking motion using the wrist and forearm for greater control. Additionally, the retraction of the spear after making contact should be swift to ensure readiness for subsequent actions.
