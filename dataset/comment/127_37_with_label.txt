The staff throw action in this video is bad. The person does not start with a firm grip on the staff, which can lead to loss of control and power during the throw. They initiate the throw by using arm strength alone, without rotating their hips and torso, resulting in less power generation. The arms are used as primary sources of power instead of levers for amplifying force. The release of the staff occurs at an inappropriate moment, leading to a loss of accuracy and power. Lastly, there is no proper follow-through after releasing the staff, which affects balance and increases the risk of injury.
