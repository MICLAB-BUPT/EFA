The staff lift action in this video is good. The individual starts with a balanced stance, ensuring a stable base. They then slightly lower their body by bending the knees, preparing to generate upward force. As they explosively extend their legs and hips upward, they begin to lift the staff, using their arms to control its direction and angle. Throughout the movement, the person maintains balance and control, transitioning smoothly into the next technique or movement without losing momentum or stability.
