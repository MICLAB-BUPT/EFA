The wrist flourish action in this video is bad because the person does not follow the proper technique for performing a wrist flourish with a sword. The movements are not fluid and continuous, and there is a lack of control over the blade's movement. Additionally, the person's stance and grip on the sword do not appear to be stable or balanced, which can lead to poor form and potential injury. To improve, the person should focus on practicing the wrist flourish technique with proper control and fluidity, maintaining a stable and balanced posture throughout the movement.
