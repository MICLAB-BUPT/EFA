The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character starts with their feet not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, which is not ideal for a stable and powerful stance. Additionally, the knees are not deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground as they should be. The hand positioning is also incorrect; instead of a scooping/raking motion, the character raises both hands up in the air, which is not a proper technique for this specific movement. To improve, the character should adjust their stance to have their feet wider apart, their knees deeply bent, and their hands positioned correctly for the 'Lou Shou' movement.
