The spear flourish action in this video is bad. The character exhibits poor control and balance, resulting in erratic movements with the spear. The initial grip on the spear is not firm enough, leading to a lack of stability during the performance. Additionally, the fluidity and precision required for a proper spear flourish are absent, with the movements appearing more like random swinging rather than controlled patterns. To improve, the character should focus on developing a strong grip, maintaining balance, and practicing fluid, continuous movements that showcase the spear's potential for both beauty and power.
