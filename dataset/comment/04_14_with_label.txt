The barbell deadlift action in this video is bad. The person has a bent-over posture with their back arched, which can lead to poor form and potential injury. They should maintain a flat back and engage their core throughout the movement. Additionally, they are not using their legs effectively; instead of driving through the heels, they appear to be lifting with their back muscles. To improve, they should focus on keeping the bar close to the body, engaging the lats, and using their legs to drive the weight upwards.
