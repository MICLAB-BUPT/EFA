The sweeping staff action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a stable stance while performing the movements. The stance is not consistent with either a horse stance or a bow stance, which are crucial for stability and control during martial arts movements. Additionally, the person's grip on the staff is not firm, and there is a lack of fluidity and continuity in the sweeping motion. To improve, the individual should focus on maintaining a stable base and using proper grip techniques to ensure better control and precision in their movements.
