The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance with the sword held naturally, initiating an upward movement from the wrist and forearm, guiding the sword in a smooth arc. The body remains relaxed but upright, maintaining a centered and balanced posture. The player uses the wrist to control the angle and precision of the movement, keeping the blade's edge facing the direction of the arc. The player also coordinates the upward arc with a subtle shift in body weight and a slight rotation of the waist, adding power and fluidity to the technique. Finally, the character completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position where it can either continue into another technique or return to a guard position.
