The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad. The character fails to transition from a preparatory stance or previous movement within the Dao form, as indicated by the incorrect grip on the sword. Additionally, the execution of the 'Pu Bu' and 'Dai Dao' movements is not fluid or coordinated with the body's core strength, leading to an unbalanced posture and less effective use of momentum. The non-wielding hand also does not assist in guiding the sword, which suggests a lack of proper technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a secure grip, executing smooth transitions between movements, and using the body's core for power generation.
