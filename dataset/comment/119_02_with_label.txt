The spinning whip action in this video is good. The person starts with a stable stance, holding the handle of the whip firmly in one hand and the chain extended, ready to be deployed. They initiate the turning motion of their body, using their legs and core strength to generate momentum. As they turn, they begin to swing the whip, utilizing the body's rotation to generate force for the whip's movement. The person continues the turning motion while swinging the whip, controlling its trajectory. Finally, they complete the turn and strike, bringing the whip to a controlled stop or transitioning into another technique. Throughout the sequence, the focus is on maintaining balance and control, demonstrating a well-executed technique.
