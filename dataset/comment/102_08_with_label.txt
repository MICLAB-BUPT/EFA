The bow stance punch action in this video is good. The individual begins in a preparatory stance with feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, which is ideal for balance and power generation. The person steps forward with one leg, bending the front knee to approximately 90 degrees while keeping the back leg straight, establishing the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance). This is crucial for stability and proper execution of the punch. Simultaneously, the person initiates the punch with the opposite hand of the front leg, extending it forward with the rotation of the body. The fist is directed towards the target at chest or face level, showing proper form. After the punch, the person retracts the fist and returns to the 'Gong Bu', maintaining balance throughout the movement. The focus on generating power from the stance and body rotation is evident, making this action both effective and precise.
