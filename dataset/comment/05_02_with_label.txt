The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person starts by lying face up on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart, and positioning the barbell across the hips. They use a pad or folded towel for comfort and place their hands on the barbell to stabilize it. The person takes a deep breath and braces the core, engaging the abdominal muscles while driving through the heels to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. They hold the bridge position briefly at the top before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control. The action demonstrates proper technique and stability throughout the exercise.
