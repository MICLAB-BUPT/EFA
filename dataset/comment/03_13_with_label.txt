The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form by keeping their back straight, core engaged, and chest up throughout the exercise. They initiate the lift with a controlled movement, keeping the barbell close to their body and using their elbows to guide the motion. The person pulls the barbell until it reaches chest level or slightly below, with their elbows higher than their wrists. They then lower the barbell back down slowly, maintaining control throughout the descent. These actions align with the ideal standards for performing an upright row, making it a well-executed exercise.
