The spear twist action in this video is bad. The person performing the action has a lack of proper form and technique, which can be observed from the beginning to the end of the motion. The grip on the spear is not firm enough, leading to an unstable stance. The contact point with the opponent's weapon is not optimal, as it does not provide enough leverage for effective control. The twisting motion is executed with too much force and jerky movements, which can compromise balance and control. Additionally, the person does not maintain constant pressure throughout the action, resulting in a less effective disarmament or control of the opponent's weapon. To improve this action, the person should focus on developing a strong and stable grip, finding the correct contact point, applying controlled and deliberate force, and maintaining continuous pressure during the twisting motion.
