The barbell bent-over row action in this video is bad. The individual does not maintain a straight back while performing the exercise, which can lead to poor posture and potential injury. Additionally, the individual's form does not appear to be controlled, as they are swinging the weight instead of using proper technique. To improve, the person should focus on keeping their back straight, maintaining control over the weight, and using proper form throughout the exercise.
