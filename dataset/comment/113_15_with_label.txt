The sweeping staff action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance and uses the power generated from their legs, core, and rotation of the waist to perform the sweep. The arms guide the staff, maintaining a firm grip and controlling the arc of the motion. The movement is fluid and continuous, showcasing good form and technique.
