The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper stance with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the dumbbells with palms facing the body and slight bend in the elbows. The core is engaged, and the chest is upright while avoiding slouching or leaning forward. The arms are raised out to the sides until parallel to the floor, controlled movement from the shoulders, and focus on lifting with the medial deltoids. The lowering phase is slow and controlled, resisting the urge to drop the weights. Overall, the execution of the exercise demonstrates good technique and adherence to ideal form.
