The crushing staff action in this video is good. The individual maintains a stable stance, which is essential for executing the technique effectively. The grip on the staff appears firm and centered, indicating a proper starting position. While the movement is brief, it demonstrates the power and speed required for the 'Beng Gun' strike. However, to refine their technique further, the individual could focus on maintaining balance and control throughout the motion, especially during the upward strike. This would ensure a more fluid transition between the stance and the strike, enhancing the overall form of the action.
