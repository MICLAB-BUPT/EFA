The sword chop action in this video is bad. The character's execution of the 'Pi' ( pi ) motion, which involves raising the Jian above the head and then bringing it down in a powerful chopping motion, is not executed properly. The deviations from the ideal form include the incorrect positioning of the Jian, with the blade not being fully extended or at an optimal angle for a clean cut. Additionally, the transition between movements is not smooth, indicating a lack of fluidity and control. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a strong grip, proper arm positioning, and a consistent flow of energy throughout the movement.
