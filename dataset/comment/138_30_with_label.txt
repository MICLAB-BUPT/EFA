The tai chi sword stir action in this video is bad. The character starts with a stable stance but loses balance during the upward movement, leading to an uncontrolled arc of the sword. The wrist does not maintain its flexibility, and the technique lacks fluidity. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a centered posture, using the waist rotation for power, and ensuring the blade's edge stays in the correct direction throughout the motion.
