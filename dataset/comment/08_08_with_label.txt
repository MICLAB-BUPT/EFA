The barbell front squat action in this video is good. The individual maintains a tight core, which is crucial for stability throughout the exercise. Their elbows remain high, and the chest stays up, contributing to proper form. Additionally, the person's feet are positioned slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with toes pointed outward, as recommended. This setup helps maintain balance during the descent and ascent of the squat. While the sequence captures only a brief moment, it demonstrates the correct positioning and technique necessary for performing an effective front squat.
