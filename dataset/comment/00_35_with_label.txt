The pull up action in this video is bad. The person starts from a dead hang, which is correct. However, the execution of the pull-up is not ideal. The individual's arms are fully extended and shoulders relaxed, but they do not engage their back and shoulder muscles properly. Instead, they use momentum to swing upwards, which is not the correct technique for a controlled pull-up. To improve, the person should focus on engaging their back and shoulder muscles throughout the movement, pulling their elbows down towards their ribs, and maintaining control while ascending and descending.
