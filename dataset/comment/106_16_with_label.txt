The bow stance head wrap action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance with a firm grip on the broadsword, which is a crucial step in establishing the correct form. As they transition into the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance), the front knee is bent to approximately 90 degrees while maintaining balance and stability. Simultaneously, the character initiates the 'Chan Tou' (head-wrapping action) with fluid movements of the broadsword around their head, demonstrating control and precision. The execution of the 'Chan Tou' is precise, and the character maintains the 'Gong Bu' throughout the movement. The transition between the steps is seamless, indicating a well-practiced technique. Overall, the character's actions align closely with the ideal standards for performing the bow stance head wrap, making it a good demonstration of the technique.
