The barbell upright row action in this video is bad. The character begins by standing with the barbell resting on their thighs, but they proceed to lift it up to their chest level without keeping their back straight and core engaged. This can lead to poor posture and increased risk of injury. To improve, the character should ensure that their back remains straight, core is engaged, and chest is up throughout the exercise. Additionally, they should maintain a slight bend in the knees and avoid pulling the barbell too high.
