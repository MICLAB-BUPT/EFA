The sweeping staff action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, and there is a lack of control over the staff. The stance is not stable, and the body does not coil slightly to store potential energy. The sweep is not executed with power generated from the ground through the legs, core, and rotation of the waist. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, coiling the body to generate power, and executing the sweep smoothly and continuously.
