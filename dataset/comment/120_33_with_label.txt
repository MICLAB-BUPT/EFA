The elbow whip action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and controlled, which can lead to a loss of precision and power in the whip technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance and using their elbow as a pivot point for redirecting the whip's momentum. Additionally, they should work on developing a consistent circular or figure-eight pattern with the whip, ensuring that the wrist and forearm play a critical role in controlling the whip's movement. Practicing these techniques will help the character achieve better control and precision in their whip handling.
