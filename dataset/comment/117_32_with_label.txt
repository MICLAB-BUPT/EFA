The sword chop action in this video is bad. The character's execution of the 'Pi' ( pi ) action, which involves raising the Jian and bringing it down for a powerful downward cut, is not performed with proper technique. The movements are not fluid or controlled, and there is a lack of power and precision in the downward motion. To improve, the character should focus on generating power from the ground up through the legs and core, using the wrist and forearm to control the blade's angle, and ensuring a clean cut. The non-wielding hand should be used for balance and to assist in generating power. Additionally, the finishing position should be refined to match the style and intended application of the form.
