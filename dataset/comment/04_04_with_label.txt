The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The man starts with the barbell positioned over his mid-foot, which is a correct starting position. He bends at the hips and knees, maintaining a flat back and engaging his core, demonstrating good form for lifting the weight. He then drives through his heels to initiate the lift, extending his legs and hips simultaneously while keeping the bar close to his body. Finally, he stands upright with fully locked out hips and knees, maintaining a neutral spine throughout the movement. His technique shows good control and strength during the exercise.
