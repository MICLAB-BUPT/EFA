The downward staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins with a firm grip on the staff, holding it at shoulder level and maintaining a stable stance. They initiate the downward swing by extending the arm and rotating the body, generating momentum through their hips and core. The free handle of the staff is brought down in a vertical arc, focusing the force through the striking surface without locking the elbow. Following through with the motion, the character maintains balance and control as the staff continues its natural arc after impact. The execution of these steps demonstrates proper technique and power generation, resulting in an effective downward staff chop.
