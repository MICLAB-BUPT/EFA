The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The person maintains a stable stance with the sword held naturally, ready to perform the technique. They initiate the upward movement from the wrist and forearm, guiding the sword in a smooth, arcing path. The elbow remains slightly bent and not overly extended, ensuring control and precision. The blade's edge faces the direction of the arc, using the wrist to control the angle and power. The person coordinates the upward arc with a subtle shift in body weight and a slight rotation of the waist, adding fluidity to the motion. Finally, the person completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position where it can continue into another technique or return to a guard position, maintaining flexibility and readiness for the next move.
