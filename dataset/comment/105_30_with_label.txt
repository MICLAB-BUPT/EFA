The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is bad. The character starts with their fists raised, but they do not properly transition into the horse stance. They should start with their feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and their knees deeply bent, with thighs parallel to the ground. The character also does not perform the downward chopping motion with both fists simultaneously, as instructed. Instead, they perform a single punch, which deviates from the ideal technique of executing the double chopping fists. To improve, the character should practice transitioning into the horse stance correctly and perform the double chopping fists with both fists simultaneously, maintaining proper form throughout the movement.
