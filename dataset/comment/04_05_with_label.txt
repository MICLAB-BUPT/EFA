The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The individual approaches the barbell with their feet hip-width apart, positioning them over the mid-foot. They bend at the hips and knees, gripping the bar just outside the legs with an overhand grip, maintaining a neutral spine and engaging their core. The person initiates the lift by driving through the heels, extending the legs and hips simultaneously while keeping the bar close to the body. They continue extending until standing upright with fully locked out hips and knees, then lower the bar under control by reversing the movement, pushing the hips back first, then bending the knees, keeping the bar close to the body.
