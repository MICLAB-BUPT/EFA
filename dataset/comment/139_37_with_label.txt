The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character initiates the sweeping motion from the waist and hips, but there's a lack of control over the blade angle and wrist movement. The blade is not kept relatively horizontal and close to the ground, leading to an unbalanced and less effective sweep. The stepping motion is also not smooth or controlled, which further compromises the stability and power of the movement. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a consistent blade angle, using their core for power, and executing a controlled and balanced stepping motion.
