The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not smooth or controlled, and the body rotation does not appear to be well-coordinated with the arm extension. The stepping motion is also not fluid, which can lead to a loss of balance and stability. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, initiating the movement from the waist and hips, and ensuring that the blade angle remains consistent throughout the sweep. Additionally, the stepping motion should be more deliberate and controlled to support the overall fluidity and power of the technique.
