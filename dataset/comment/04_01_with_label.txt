The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The woman approaches the barbell with her feet hip-width apart and positioned over the mid-foot, which is ideal for stability and balance. She grips the bar just outside the legs with an overhand grip, maintaining a neutral spine by engaging her core. As she initiates the lift, she drives through the heels, extending the legs and hips simultaneously, keeping the bar close to her body. She then stands upright with the hips and knees fully locked out while maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core. Finally, she lowers the bar under control by reversing the movement, pushing the hips back first, then bending the knees, keeping the bar close to her body. Overall, her form is well-executed, demonstrating proper technique and control throughout the exercise.
