The barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The primary issue is the poor upper body biomechanics, particularly the excessive flaring of the elbows, which are extending far past the recommended 45-75 degree angle relative to the torso. This position places significant and dangerous stress directly on the anterior shoulder capsule, increasing the risk of impingement and rotator cuff injury, while also reducing pectoral muscle activation. Additionally, the athlete lacks full lower body stability, as the feet are not securely planted and flat on the floor, compromising the leg drive necessary for a strong press. To improve, the athlete must tuck the elbows to maintain a safe 45-60 degree angle and ensure the feet are fully planted to establish a stable four-point contact (head, shoulders, glutes, and feet) with the ground for maximum force transfer.
