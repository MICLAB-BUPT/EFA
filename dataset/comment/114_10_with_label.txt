The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The individual begins in a stable stance, holding the staff with a firm grip. They prepare for the 'Ti' (lifting) action by positioning the staff low near the ground or at waist level, with slight body coiling to generate upward power. As the staff is lifted upwards, the wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff outwards, creating an upward and outward scooping motion. The power is generated from the legs and core, transferred through the lifting motion, and amplified by the wrist flick. After the 'Ti', the individual retracts the staff to a guard position, maintaining balance and control throughout the sequence. This action is executed with precision and fluidity, demonstrating a strong grasp of the technique.
