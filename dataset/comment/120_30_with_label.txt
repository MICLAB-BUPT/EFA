The elbow whip action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a stable stance, which is essential for controlling the whip. The execution of the 'Guai Zhou' (elbow-hooking or elbow-turning) action is also suboptimal, as the person does not use their elbow effectively to redirect the whip's momentum. Additionally, the whip is swung without proper control, resulting in an incomplete and poorly executed technique. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a stable stance, using their elbow effectively, and controlling the whip throughout the movement.
