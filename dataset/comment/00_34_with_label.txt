The pull up action in this video is bad. The character is not gripping the bar with an overhand grip, which is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. This incorrect grip may result in reduced effectiveness of the exercise and potential injury. To improve, the character should adjust their grip to meet these standards. Additionally, the character's body position is not optimal; they are not pulling their elbows down towards their ribs but rather just pulling with their arms. This could lead to a less effective workout and increased risk of strain. The character should focus on pulling their shoulder blades down and back while keeping their elbows close to their body for better form.
