The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a controlled and fluid movement, starting from a preparatory stance with the Dao held securely in one hand. They execute the drop step or flat step ('Pu Bu') by bending both knees and shifting weight onto one leg while extending the other leg to the side, maintaining balance throughout. Simultaneously, they perform the 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action) with the Dao, sweeping it across the body in a controlled manner. The character's movements are coordinated and demonstrate core strength and stability, transitioning smoothly between steps. Overall, the execution of the pounce step carrying knife action in this video aligns well with ideal standards for form and technique.
