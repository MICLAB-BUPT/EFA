The spear flourish action in this video is bad. The person's movements are not fluid and continuous, as they appear to be struggling with the spear and not maintaining control of it. Additionally, there is a lack of precision and grace in the movements, making them appear unappealing. To improve, the person should focus on developing their grip, wrist movement, and overall body control to create a more dynamic and visually appealing display.
