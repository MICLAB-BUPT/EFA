The cloud hands action in this video is good. The performer begins from a neutral stance and transitions smoothly into side-to-side movements, maintaining the weight evenly distributed. The hand movements are coordinated and circular, passing each other without crossing directly. The performer maintains focus and awareness throughout the sequence, driven by the waist. While the performer repeats the 'Yun Shou' movement multiple times, there is no indication of any significant refinement needed for achieving greater form.
