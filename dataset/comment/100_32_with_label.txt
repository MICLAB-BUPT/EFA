The cloud hands action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, as the weight shift from one leg to the other is abrupt. Additionally, the hand movements are not coordinated and circular, but rather appear disjointed and less connected. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a relaxed stance with evenly distributed weight and gradually shifting their body as they move their hands in a continuous, flowing motion.
