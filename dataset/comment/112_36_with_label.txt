The staff point action in this video is bad. The character appears to be performing the movement with a lack of control and precision, which is evident from the swift and unsteady motion. This could lead to an ineffective strike and a loss of balance. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance and generating power from the ground up through the legs and core. Additionally, the arm should be extended with precision, and the body should remain balanced throughout the movement.
