The spear crush action in this video is bad. The character fails to initiate the movement with a stable stance, as they begin with an awkward foot position. Additionally, the execution of the thrust is not smooth; instead of a continuous motion, there appears to be a jerky or uneven extension of the arm and body. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper form from the start by assuming a balanced stance and ensuring fluidity in their movements during the thrust.
