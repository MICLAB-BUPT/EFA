The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The character begins with an incorrect posture, as the body is not properly aligned and the grip on the sword is not firm but relaxed. Additionally, there is no clear indication of the 'Gong Bu' stance being established, and the 'Chan Tou' motion is not fluid or controlled. The character needs to improve their posture, grip, and motion to align with proper bow stance head wrap form.
