The sword sweep action in this video is good. The person begins in a stable stance, with the sword held firmly but not rigidly. They initiate the sweeping motion from the waist and hips, rotating their body in the direction of the sweep. The arm holding the sword extends outward, keeping the blade relatively horizontal and close to the ground. The person maintains a consistent blade angle throughout the sweep, with the wrist firm but not locked. The stepping motion is smooth and controlled, maintaining balance throughout the movement. The person completes the sweep by bringing the sword to a controlled stop, in a guard position or ready for the next movement.
