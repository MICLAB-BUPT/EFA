The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad. The character does not demonstrate the correct form and technique for executing a 'Pu Bu' (drop step or flat step) while simultaneously performing a 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action with the Dao). This lack of coordination and control in their movements results in poor execution, making it difficult to follow through with a fluid and powerful movement. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper balance and stance during the drop step, ensuring that the drawing of the Dao is controlled and executed with precision. Additionally, they should practice the movements in isolation before combining them into a single sequence to build muscle memory and ensure accurate execution.
