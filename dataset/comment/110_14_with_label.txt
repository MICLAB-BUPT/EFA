The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The person starts in a preparatory stance, holding the sword firmly but with a relaxed grip. They then initiate the 'Pi Dao' (chopping action) on one side, raising the sword in an arc and bringing it down in a smooth motion. The power is generated from the ground through the legs and core, transferred through the arm to the blade. After completing the chop on one side, they transition to the other side, maintaining balance and control throughout the sequence. The movements are fluid and continuous, showcasing a well-practiced technique.
