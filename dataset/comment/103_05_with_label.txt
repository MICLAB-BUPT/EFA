The horse stance punch action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a solid 'Ma Bu' (horse stance) with feet positioned wider than shoulder-width apart, knees deeply bent, and the back straight with core engagement. The hands are correctly positioned, one chambered at the waist while the other is in a guard position. The execution of the 'Chong Quan' (thrusting punch) is also precise, with the power generated from the ground and a slight rotation of the waist. The punch is delivered forward with the fist aiming at chest or face level, maintaining stability and balance throughout the movement.
