The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The character starts with a stable stance, holding the sword naturally and maintaining a centered and balanced posture. They initiate the upward movement from the wrist and forearm, guiding the sword in a smooth arc. The blade's edge faces the direction of the arc, using the wrist to control the angle and precision of the movement. The character completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position where it can continue into another technique or return to a guard position. The wrist remains flexible, ready for the transition.
