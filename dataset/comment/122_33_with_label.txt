The cross drape red action in this video is bad. The character starts by swinging the hammer head in a circular motion, which is not the intended direction for the 'Shi Zi' pattern. Additionally, the rope is not being used effectively to trace the desired cross-shaped pattern. To improve, the character should focus on executing the vertical and horizontal swings with precision, ensuring that the rope stays taut and the movements are fluid and continuous.
