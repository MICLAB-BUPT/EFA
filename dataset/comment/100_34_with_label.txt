The cloud hands action in this video is bad. The person starts with an incorrect stance, as they are not centered and the weight is not evenly distributed. Their knees are not slightly bent, and their body is not relaxed. The movement of shifting weight from one leg to the other is not gradual or continuous; it appears to be a sudden step. Additionally, the hand movements are not coordinated or circular; instead, they seem disconnected and awkward. The person's eyes do not follow the upper hand, indicating a lack of focus and awareness. To improve, the person should begin in a neutral stance, maintain a continuous weight shift, and perform coordinated, circular hand movements while keeping their body relaxed and centered.
