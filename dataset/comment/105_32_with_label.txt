The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not wide enough, and the toes are not pointing forward or slightly outward. The fists are not positioned correctly for the downward chopping motion, and the power generation is not coming from the core and 'Ma Bu'. Additionally, the elbows are not bent at the point of impact, and the fists are not angled correctly. To improve, the character should adjust their stance to be wider with the toes pointed forward or slightly outward, position the fists correctly for the downward chopping motion, generate power from the core and 'Ma Bu', and angle the fists correctly at the point of impact with bent elbows.
