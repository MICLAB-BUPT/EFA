The bow stance head wrap action in this video is good. The individual maintains a firm but relaxed grip on the Dao, demonstrating control and fluidity in their movements. They transition from a preparatory stance to a 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with one leg stepping forward and bending at approximately 90 degrees while keeping the back leg straight. Simultaneously, they initiate the 'Chan Tou' (head-wrapping action) with the Dao moving in a circular or figure-eight motion around the head, maintaining a controlled and precise execution. The other hand assists in balancing and controlling the Dao's momentum throughout the movement. Overall, the individual exhibits good technique and form in performing the bow stance head wrap.
