The spear point action in this video is good. The person starts in a balanced and agile stance, preparing to move quickly and accurately. They identify the target and initiate a quick, controlled step or shift in body weight towards the target. The person extends the spear arm forward with a quick, snapping motion, primarily using the wrist and forearm, which aligns with the ideal steps for executing a precise spear tip. Finally, they retract the spear after making contact, returning to a ready position. These actions demonstrate focus, precision, and control, making it an effective spear point technique.
