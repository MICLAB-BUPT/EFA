The barbell front squat action in this video is good. The person maintains an upright torso throughout the movement, with a tight core providing support to the spine. The barbell is positioned across the shoulders close to the throat, supported by the anterior deltoids. The feet are slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and the toes are pointed outward. The person bends at the hips and knees simultaneously while keeping the chest up and the elbows high. The descent is controlled until the hip crease is below the top of the knee or to a comfortable depth. The ascent is initiated by driving through the heels, extending the hips and knees, and returning to the starting position with the barbell still on the shoulders. These actions demonstrate proper form and technique for a barbell front squat, ensuring stability and control throughout the exercise.
