The decline barbell bench press action in this video is bad. Similar to the previous video, the athlete is incorrectly performing a triceps extension (skull crusher) rather than a decline bench press due to the extremely narrow grip and the bar path traveling towards the forehead/behind the head. This targets the triceps, not the pectorals, and puts unnecessary strain on the elbow joints. The athlete also lacks full control during the eccentric phase, causing the bar to drop rapidly. Furthermore, the athlete is using a fixed-weight short bar, which limits the ability to achieve a proper chest-targeting grip width. To execute a proper decline bench press, the athlete must use a wider grip, lower the bar to the lower chest, maintain a moderate elbow tuck (45-75 degrees), and control the movement speed through both the eccentric and concentric phases.
