The spinning whip action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance and holds the handle of the whip firmly, initiating the turning motion of the body with precision. The whip is swung with control and momentum, transitioning smoothly through the technique. The character demonstrates a strong grasp on the whip's movement, using the body's rotation effectively to generate force. The execution of the 'Fan Shen' (turning of the body) and the swing of the whip are fluid, showcasing skill and balance throughout the sequence.
