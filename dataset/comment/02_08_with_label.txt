The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back and neutral head position throughout the exercise, ensuring proper form. Their feet are shoulder-width apart, providing stability during the movement. They execute the descent by slowly lowering the barbell to their lower chest or upper abdomen without using momentum or rounding the back. This controlled movement ensures that the focus remains on squeezing the shoulder blades together at the top of the exercise. The individual's technique is refined and demonstrates good barbell bent-over row form.
