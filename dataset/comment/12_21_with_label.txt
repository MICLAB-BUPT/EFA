The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper stance with feet shoulder-width apart, keeping the elbows slightly bent throughout the exercise. The person also keeps the core engaged and maintains an upright posture, avoiding slouching or leaning forward. Additionally, the arms are raised out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, and the movement is controlled, initiated from the shoulders. The focus on lifting with the medial deltoids is evident, and the lowering phase is executed slowly, emphasizing control. These aspects contribute to the effectiveness of the exercise and minimize potential injury risks.
