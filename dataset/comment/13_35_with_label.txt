The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is bad. The man in the video is lying on a bench with his feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. However, he does not keep his upper arms stationary throughout the exercise and his elbows are not bent at a slight angle. This can lead to improper muscle engagement and potential injury. To improve this, the man should focus on keeping his upper arms perpendicular to the floor and bending his elbows slightly during the exercise.
