The staff chop action in this video is bad. The person starts by holding the staff above their head, which is not an ideal starting position for a powerful downward strike. They also begin the movement with their legs together and body facing forward, lacking the initial stance that provides stability and control. Additionally, they do not execute the 'Pi' (chopping) motion with enough force or precision, as the staff does not move directly downwards towards the intended target. To improve, the person should start in a stable stance, raise the staff above their head coiling slightly, initiate the 'Pi' motion with force and precision, and ensure the staff moves directly downwards to maximize power and effectiveness.
