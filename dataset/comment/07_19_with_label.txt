The barbell back squat action in this video is classified as 'good'. The woman starts with the barbell resting on her upper back, standing with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing outward. She takes a deep breath and braces her core, maintaining a neutral spine and keeping her chest up. As she squats, she bends at the hips and knees simultaneously, descending until her hip crease is below the top of her knee. Finally, she drives through her heels to return to the starting position, maintaining a consistent back angle throughout the ascent and keeping her core braced.
