The spear crush action in this video is bad. The character starts with a stable stance, but there is no clear indication of the grip being firm yet not tense, which is crucial for control and power generation. Additionally, the forward lunge is executed without proper weight transfer, resulting in an unbalanced movement. The rear arm's extension is also not shown to be driving the spearhead forward, indicating that the burst action is lacking. Lastly, the front hand does not appear to be stabilizing or guiding the spear accurately, further suggesting a lack of precision in the technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a firm yet relaxed grip, ensuring proper weight transfer during the lunge, and executing a powerful and controlled burst with the rear arm while using the front hand for stabilization.
