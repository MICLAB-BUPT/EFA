The staff parry action in this video is bad. The character starts in an unstable stance, which compromises the ability to execute a proper parry effectively. Additionally, the movement appears rushed and lacks precision, which is critical for a successful parry. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining balance, using proper hand positioning, and executing controlled, deliberate movements.
