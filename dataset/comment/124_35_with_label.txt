The scissor flourish action in this video is bad. The character has poor control of the sword, resulting in a lack of precision and stability. This could be due to insufficient wrist rotation or improper grip on the handle. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a firm yet relaxed grip and ensure proper wrist movement for better control.
