The sword stir action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, with the sword held firmly but relaxedly. They prepare for the upward cutting or raising action by positioning the sword low near the waist, with the blade angled slightly downwards or forwards. As they initiate the Liao Jian (upward cut), they use the power generated from the ground, transferring it through their arm to the blade, with the wrist and forearm playing a crucial role in controlling the arc and angle of the cut. The non-wielding hand moves for balance or to assist in controlling the sword's momentum. Finally, the character completes the Liao Jian, bringing the sword to a higher position, often near the head or shoulder level, with the finishing position depending on the form. Overall, the character demonstrates good technique and control throughout the sword stir action.
