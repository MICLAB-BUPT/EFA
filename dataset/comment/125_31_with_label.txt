The staff parry action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid or controlled, and the stance is not stable. This lack of precision and control could make it difficult for the opponent to predict the direction of the parry, which is an essential aspect of effective staff fighting. To improve, the character should work on maintaining a stable stance, focusing on precise hand positioning, and practicing quick, controlled movements.
