The spinning whip action in this video is bad because the person is not using their body's rotation to generate momentum for the whip. The person should initiate the 'Fan Shen' (turning of the body) by rotating their torso, typically 180 degrees or more, using their legs and core strength. Additionally, the person's grip on the whip handle is not ideal, as it appears they are holding it too loosely, which could affect control during the swing. To improve, the person should practice maintaining a stable stance with a firm grip on the whip handle while rotating their body to generate the necessary force for the whip's movement.
