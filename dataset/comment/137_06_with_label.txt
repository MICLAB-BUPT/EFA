The sword point action in this video is good. The individual maintains a balanced and agile stance, ready to move quickly and precisely with the sword held in a relaxed grip. They execute a controlled step towards the target, initiating a quick wrist snap for precision. The tip of the sword makes contact with the target, emphasizing accuracy and speed. The person then immediately withdraws the sword tip after making contact, returning to a ready position. These actions demonstrate proper technique, control, and precision in sword point execution.
