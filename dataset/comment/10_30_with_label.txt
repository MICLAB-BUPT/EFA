The decline barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The most critical issue is the athlete's grip, which is a thumb-less "suicide grip" that is extremely dangerous, increasing the risk of the barbell slipping and causing severe injury. Additionally, the athlete is using dumbbells, not a barbell, which is a misclassification of the exercise. Furthermore, the elbows flare out excessively during the lift, placing undue stress on the shoulder joints. The descent depth is also incomplete, stopping well short of achieving a full range of motion. To correct this, the athlete must use a fully closed, thumbaround grip for safety, control the descent fully to at least a 90-degree elbow bend, and maintain a moderate elbow tuck (45-75 degrees) to protect the shoulders and better target the pectorals.
