The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is 'good'. The individual starts by lying on the decline bench with their feet securely placed under the pads, positioning their eyes slightly below the barbell. They grip the barbell with a full grip and unrack it with arms extended, maintaining a straight wrist position and a slight elbow bend. The person then lowers the barbell to the lower chest area, keeping their elbows tucked in and the torso stable. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position, extending their arms while exhaling forcefully, with core and glute engagement throughout the movement.
