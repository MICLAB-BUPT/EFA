The sword point action in this video is good. The character maintains a balanced and agile stance, ready to move quickly and precisely. The sword is held with a relaxed grip, allowing for maximum wrist flexibility and control of the blade tip. The player initiates a small, controlled step or shift in body weight towards the target, preparing for the rapid wrist action. The quick, snapping motion of the wrist is used to flick the tip of the sword forward towards the target, emphasizing precision and accuracy. The 'point' is light and fast, like a dragonfly skimming the water. After making contact with the target, the player immediately withdraws the sword tip, returning to a ready position. This quick retraction is crucial for defense and to prepare for subsequent movements.
