The staff lift action in this video is bad. The character starts with a balanced stance, but there is no mention of bending the knees or preparing to generate upward force. The upward motion is not described as smooth and controlled, and there is no indication of maintaining balance and control throughout the movement. To improve, the character should start by lowering their body, preparing for an upward motion, and using the legs and hips to drive the staff upwards while maintaining balance and control.
