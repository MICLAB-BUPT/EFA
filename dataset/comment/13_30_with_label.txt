The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is bad. The individual is not lying flat on the bench with feet flat on the floor, which is a critical aspect of proper form for this exercise. Additionally, they are not keeping their upper arms stationary and only moving at the elbow joint, which is essential for targeting the correct muscle group. Furthermore, the individual's posture appears to be poor, with an excessive arch in the lower back, leading to potential strain or injury. To improve this, the person should ensure they lie flat on the bench with their feet securely planted on the ground, maintain a stable torso by engaging the core, and focus on controlled movements that emphasize the elbow movement while keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the floor.
