The crushing staff action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a stable stance, as indicated by the lack of a horse or bow stance. This can lead to instability and reduced control during the technique. Additionally, there is no clear indication of the 'Beng' (bursting) action being initiated, which suggests that the person may be lacking proper preparation and execution for the strike. To improve, the person should focus on establishing a strong base with a stable stance before transitioning into the bursting action, ensuring proper form and control throughout the movement.
