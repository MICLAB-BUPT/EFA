The barbell back squat action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits a critical fault known as "butt wink" (posterior pelvic tilt) at the bottom of the descent, causing the lumbar spine to round slightly under load, which exposes the lower back to significant injury risk. This is often caused by a combination of poor hamstring and ankle mobility. While the bar is racked high, which is acceptable, the athlete also fails to reach adequate depth, stopping well above parallel. Furthermore, the knees track slightly inward during the ascent, indicating weak hip abductors or glute medius activation. To correct this, the athlete needs to work on hip and ankle mobility to achieve depth without lumbar rounding. They must also brace the core tightly to maintain a neutral spine throughout the full range of motion, and actively push the knees out to engage the hip musculature.
