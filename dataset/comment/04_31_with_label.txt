The barbell deadlift action in this video is bad. The man starts with his feet positioned too close together and not hip-width apart, which can affect balance and stability during the lift. Additionally, he does not properly engage his core or brace himself as if preparing to be punched in the stomach, which is crucial for maintaining a stable spine during the lift. Furthermore, he does not drive through his heels and extend his legs and hips simultaneously, leading to a less efficient and potentially unsafe lifting technique. To improve, he should ensure proper foot positioning, engage his core throughout the movement, and maintain a neutral spine while driving through his heels and extending his legs and hips in unison.
