The spear crush action in this video is bad. The person starts by holding the spear with both hands, but they don't perform a proper lunge or forward movement before initiating the thrust. Instead, they just stand and start to swing the spear around, which doesn't provide the necessary momentum for a powerful thrust. To improve this, the person should practice stepping forward with the front leg, transferring weight, and initiating a forward lunge before extending the rear arm to drive the spearhead towards the target. This would provide the necessary momentum and power for a proper spear crush technique.
