The staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins with a stable stance, providing a solid foundation for the powerful downward strike. The Nangun is held with a firm grip, ensuring control and leverage. The preparation for the 'Pi' ( pi ) involves raising the Nangun above the head or shoulder, positioning it for a downward strike. The body coils slightly to store potential energy, leading to a powerful downward striking motion, known as the 'Pi Gun' ( pi gun ). The movement is vertical, generating power from the ground through the legs and core, transferred through the arms to the staff. The finishing position is near the waist or thigh, depending on the style and intended application. The transition to the next movement is smooth, showcasing the character's skill and precision in executing the staff chop.
