The back flourish action in this video is bad. The character begins with a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao, but there is no description of the stance or preparation for the technique. The execution of the circular or figure-eight motion behind the back is also not detailed, which might indicate that the movement is not fluid and continuous. Additionally, the non-wielding hand does not move in a coordinated manner for balance, as described in the ideal steps. To improve, the character should ensure that the grip is firm yet relaxed, maintain proper stance and preparation, execute the circular motion smoothly, and coordinate the non-wielding hand for balance.
