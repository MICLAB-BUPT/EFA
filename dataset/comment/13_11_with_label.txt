The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual starts by lying face up on the bench with feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. The arms are extended straight up above the chest, keeping a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. The upper arms remain stationary throughout the exercise, and the only movement occurs at the elbow joint. The individual takes a breath and braces the core, maintaining a stable torso on the bench while avoiding arching the lower back excessively. The person slowly lowers the dumbbells towards the forehead or slightly behind the head for a greater stretch, bending the elbows while keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the floor. Finally, the individual extends the arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement, and exhales during the upward push, avoiding locking out the elbows.
