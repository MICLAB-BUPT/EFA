The bow stance head wrap action in this video is good. The character starts in a preparatory stance, with the Dao held in one hand and a firm grip. They transition into a 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) by stepping forward with one leg bent at approximately 90 degrees while keeping the back leg straight with the heel on the ground. Simultaneously, the character initiates the 'Chan Tou' (head-wrapping action) with the Dao moving in a circular or figure-eight motion around the head without making contact. The movement is controlled and fluid, driven by the wrist, forearm, and body rotation. Finally, the character completes the 'Chan Tou' and returns to the starting position, maintaining the 'Gong Bu' throughout. The actions are precise, coordinated, and executed with a good level of control and balance.
