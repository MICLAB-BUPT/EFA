The barbell front squat action in this video is good. The person maintains an upright torso, keeping the chest up and the elbows high throughout the exercise. They also maintain a tight core while performing the squat, which helps support the spine. The descent into the squat is controlled, with the hip crease staying below the top of the knee, and the person returns to the starting position by driving through the heels. Overall, the execution of the front squat is precise and demonstrates proper form.
