The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is good. The character begins from a preparatory stance, transitioning smoothly into the 'Pu Bu' (drop step) while maintaining control of the Dao (broadsword). The fluidity and coordination of the movements are evident as the character performs the 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action) with precision. The body's core strength and weight shifting are effectively used to generate power during the movement. The character maintains a low, stable stance throughout the sequence, ensuring balance and control. Overall, the execution of the technique is well-coordinated and demonstrates skillful handling of the weapon.
