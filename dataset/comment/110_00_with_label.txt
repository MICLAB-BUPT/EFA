The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The person demonstrates proper technique by maintaining a relaxed grip on the Dao, initiating the chopping motion with a controlled arc, and transferring power from the ground through the arm to the blade. The sequence is smooth and continuous, with the person transitioning between left and right chops while maintaining balance and control.
