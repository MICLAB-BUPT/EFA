The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad. The character begins in a neutral stance, but the following steps are executed poorly. Firstly, the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) is not properly established as the front knee does not align over the ankle, and the back leg is not straight with the heel on the ground. Secondly, the 'Zha Dao' (thrusting action) is initiated without maintaining balance or control of the Dao, leading to an ineffective thrust. Lastly, the character fails to maintain the 'Gong Bu' throughout the action, which compromises stability and power in the thrust. To improve, the character should focus on correct footwork, arm positioning, and body alignment during the 'Gong Bu' and 'Zha Dao' techniques.
