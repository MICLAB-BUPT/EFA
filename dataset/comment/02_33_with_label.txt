The barbell bent-over row action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits significant instability and suboptimal form, primarily due to an insufficient hip hinge and lack of back rigidity. The hips are too low, and the back angle is overly vertical (approximately 45-50 degrees), reducing the leverage for the posterior chain and shifting the exercise focus from the lats to the traps and biceps. The rowing path is poor; instead of pulling the barbell to the lower chest/upper abdomen, the bar travels vertically towards the torso, indicating an arm-dominant pull rather than a back-dominant one. To correct this, the athlete must initiate the movement with a deeper hip hinge, maintaining a torso angle closer to parallel (30-45 degrees), keep the spine neutral, and drive the elbows back and toward the hips to engage the lats effectively.
