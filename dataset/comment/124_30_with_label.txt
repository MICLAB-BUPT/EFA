The scissor flourish action in this video is bad. The person in the video performs the scissor flourish with a loose grip on the handle of the Nandao, which may not provide the necessary control and stability required for the technique. Additionally, the stance appears to be unstable and unbalanced, which can affect the execution of the crossing movements and the overall effectiveness of the scissor pattern. To improve this, the person should work on developing a firm but relaxed grip, maintaining a stable and balanced posture, and focusing on proper wrist, forearm, and body rotation to generate power and control the blade's trajectory.
