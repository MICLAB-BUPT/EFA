The sword chop action in this video is bad. The character starts by holding the sword with both hands, which is not ideal as it may not provide enough control or power for a proper chop. In the second frame, the character swings the sword upwards, but the movement appears to be abrupt and lacks fluidity, which can reduce the effectiveness of the chop. Additionally, the character's posture is not optimal, with their body leaning forward too much, which might affect balance and stability during the chop. To improve, the character should start with a relaxed grip, initiate the chop with a smooth upward motion, and maintain a balanced posture throughout the movement.
