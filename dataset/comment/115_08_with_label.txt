The staff flourish action in this video is good. The character begins with a firm yet relaxed grip on the staff, which allows for better control and fluidity of movement. They initiate the 'Wu' ( wu ) by performing controlled, circular motions of the staff, primarily driven by their wrists, forearms, and body rotation. This creates the 'Hua' ( hua ), or the visual pattern, with a continuous, flowing motion that showcases dexterity and coordination. The non-wielding hand moves in a coordinated manner to enhance the visual effect. Overall, the performer demonstrates proficiency in maintaining control and creating distinct patterns, making it an effective practice session for developing staff skills.
