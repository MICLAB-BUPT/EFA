The staff parry action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not stable, and the grip on the Nangun is not firm. The body position does not align with the intended direction of the 'Bo Gun', resulting in an ineffective movement. Additionally, the execution of the 'Bo' is not quick or controlled, lacking precision and timing. To improve, the character should start in a stable stance, adjust their grip for better control, and practice the movement with more focus on speed, accuracy, and balance.
