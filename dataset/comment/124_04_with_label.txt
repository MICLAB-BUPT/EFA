The scissor flourish action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable and balanced posture throughout the sequence, ensuring proper control of the Nandao (Southern Broadsword). They execute the crossing movements with precision, creating a clear 'scissor' pattern. The wrist, forearm, and body rotation are used effectively to generate power and control the blade's trajectory. Additionally, the non-wielding hand moves for balance, demonstrating a well-practiced technique. These aspects contribute to the overall effectiveness and fluidity of the scissor flourish, making it a refined and skillful performance.
