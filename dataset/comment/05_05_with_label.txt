The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person lies on their back with knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart, which is ideal for performing a glute bridge. They place their hands on the barbell to stabilize it and engage their core by bracing their abdomen, ensuring proper form and control. As they drive through the heels, they lift their hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees, maintaining full hip extension. Finally, they hold the bridge position for a brief pause before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control, avoiding touching the ground forcefully. This sequence of actions demonstrates good technique and control throughout the exercise.
