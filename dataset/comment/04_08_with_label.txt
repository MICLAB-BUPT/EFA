The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back and engages the core throughout the exercise, which are key aspects of proper form. They approach the bar with their feet hip-width apart and grip it outside the legs, ensuring stability. Additionally, they brace the core before initiating the lift, creating tension in the body and reducing the risk of injury. While standing upright, they keep the bar close to the body and lower it under control by reversing the movement, demonstrating proper technique.
