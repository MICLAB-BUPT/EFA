The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character begins with their feet not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, and the toes are not pointing forward or slightly outward. This deviation from the ideal stance can affect balance and power generation during the movement. To improve, the character should adjust their foot placement to ensure proper alignment and maintain a stable foundation throughout the exercise.
