The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad because the individual did not follow the ideal steps for performing the exercise. The character's elbows were locked out during the movement, which is a common mistake that can lead to potential injury and decreased effectiveness of the exercise. Additionally, the character did not maintain proper form throughout the exercise, which includes keeping the core engaged, maintaining an upright posture, and focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. To improve the exercise, the character should focus on controlling the movement, using the correct technique, and avoiding locking out the elbows.
