The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back, slightly bends their knees, and keeps the barbell hanging straight down from their shoulders at the starting position. They then pull the barbell up towards their lower chest or upper abdomen with elbows close to their body and maintain control throughout the descent. The person does not round their back or use momentum to swing the weight, which are all key aspects of proper form for a barbell bent-over row.
