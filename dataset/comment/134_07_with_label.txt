Additionally, the character incorporates body movements such as stepping and turning, enhancing the flow and dynamism of the  wu hua gun . The transitions between different planes of motion are smooth, showcasing a well-practiced and skillful technique. Overall, the character's execution of the nunchaku flourish aligns with ideal standards, making it a good demonstration.
