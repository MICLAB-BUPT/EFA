The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not properly aligned, with the feet not positioned correctly and the body leaning too far to one side. This imbalance could lead to poor control and execution of the technique. To improve, the character should ensure that their feet are shoulder-width apart and their body is centered over the legs while maintaining a balanced posture. Additionally, the grip on the sword should be firm yet relaxed, allowing for better maneuverability and control during the movement.
