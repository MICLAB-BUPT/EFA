The staff flourish action in this video is bad because the person's grip on the staff is not firm yet relaxed, and the stance is not neutral or horse stance. Additionally, the movements are not controlled, circular, or figure-eight motions as described in the ideal steps. To improve, the person should practice starting with a proper grip and stance, focusing on continuous and flowing motions while maintaining control of the staff.
