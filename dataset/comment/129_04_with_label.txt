The spear crush action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a stable stance with proper grip on the spear, initiating the movement with a forward lunge and extending the rear arm for a straight thrust. The front hand guides the spear's direction throughout the motion, ensuring precision and control. The completion of the thrust with full extension of the arm and body showcases good technique and balance.
