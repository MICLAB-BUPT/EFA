The staff lift action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and controlled, as the arm begins to lift the staff before the legs are fully extended. This lack of coordination can lead to instability and a loss of momentum during the upward motion. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining balance throughout the movement and ensuring that the legs are fully extended before the arms begin to lift the staff. Additionally, the character could benefit from practicing proper footwork and body positioning to achieve a more powerful and stable lift.
