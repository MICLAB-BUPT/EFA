The sword thrust action in this video is good. The individual begins in a balanced stance with the sword held firmly, initiating the thrust smoothly from the core and extending through the arm. The simultaneous step forward adds power to the thrust, and the person maintains a straight line from the back heel to the tip of the sword, emphasizing precision and control. The completion of the thrust with full extension showcases strength and balance.
