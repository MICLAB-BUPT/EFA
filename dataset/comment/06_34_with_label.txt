The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual starts with a wide stance, ensuring the barbell is positioned over mid-foot and the shins are slightly bent. They then hinge at the hips, maintaining a straight back and neutral spine, which helps maintain core engagement and control throughout the lift. The person grips the barbell with an overhand or mixed grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, which provides stability and allows for better control during the lift. As they lower the barbell, they maintain tension in the hamstrings and feel a stretch, which is crucial for proper form and muscle engagement. The individual then reverses the motion by driving through their heels, extending the hips, and squeezing the glutes while keeping the back straight. Throughout the entire lift, the person maintains a slight bend in the knees, which aids in controlling the movement and prevents unnecessary strain on the back.
