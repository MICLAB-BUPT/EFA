The wrist flourish action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a controlled and fluid motion with the Jian, creating visually appealing patterns on the blade. The technique appears to be well-practiced, showing clear control over the sword's movements. To enhance the performance further, the character could focus on increasing speed and complexity while maintaining precision. This would involve refining the transition between different stages of the 'Wan Hua' technique, ensuring that each movement is smooth and continuous. Additionally, incorporating more dynamic variations into the practice routine can help improve overall skill and technique.
