The staff throw action in this video is bad. The character begins with a firm grip on the staff, but the stance appears to be stable and not in a fighting stance. The core rotation is initiated correctly, but the extension of the arms outward does not follow through as expected, resulting in an incomplete release. The release moment seems premature, and the follow-through is not fully utilized. To improve, the character should ensure proper stance, initiate core rotation effectively, extend arms with full force, and release at the right timing to maximize power and accuracy.
