The rope slide action in this video is bad. The person is not holding the rope with a secure grip and does not initiate the 'Liu Sheng' action properly. They are also not controlling the amount of rope being released smoothly, which indicates a lack of practice and proficiency in the technique. To improve, the person should focus on developing a strong grip, learning to control the rope's speed and tension, and practicing the 'Liu Sheng' action in various contexts to increase their proficiency.
