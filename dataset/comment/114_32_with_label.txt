The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is bad. The character starts by not holding the staff with a firm grip, which can lead to instability during the technique. Additionally, there is no visible coiling of the body, which would provide power for the upward motion. The wrist and forearm are not working together to flick the tip of the staff upwards and outwards, which would be more effective if executed correctly. To improve, the character should ensure a stable stance, grip the staff firmly, coil the body for power, and execute the wrist flick accurately.
