The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The woman is lying on an inclined bench with her feet flat on the floor, and her eyes are directly under the barbell when it's racked. She has a full grip on the barbell with her wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked. As she unracks the barbell, she takes a deep breath and braces her core. She lowers the barbell under control to her upper chest, keeping her elbows tucked in at a roughly 45-75 degree angle to the body. Finally, she pushes the barbell back up to the starting position by extending her arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. Her form throughout the exercise is excellent, demonstrating proper technique for an incline barbell bench press.
