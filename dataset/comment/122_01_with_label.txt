The cross drape red action in this video is good. The performer begins with a secure grip on the Liuxingchui and initiates the 'Shi Zi' pattern by swinging the rope and hammer head in a cross-shaped motion. The vertical component of the cross is executed smoothly, with controlled wrist and forearm movements. The horizontal component is also performed with precision, transitioning from one side to the other while keeping the rope taut. The 'Pi Hong' aspect adds continuity and artistry to the technique. Overall, the performance is fluid and demonstrates a good understanding of the form and execution of the cross drape red.
