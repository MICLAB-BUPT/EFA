The sword chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the sword firmly with a relaxed grip, which is an ideal starting position for executing the downward chopping motion. They then initiate the 'Pi' action by raising the sword above their head and positioning it for a downward cut. This movement is executed with power, generated from the ground through the legs and core to the blade, ensuring a clean cut. The wrist and forearm control the blade's angle, and the non-wielding hand assists in generating power. The transition to the next movement is smooth, showcasing skill and precision. Overall, the character demonstrates proper technique and form, making the sword chop action effective and visually appealing.
