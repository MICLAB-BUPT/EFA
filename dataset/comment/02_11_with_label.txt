The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper grip on the barbell, keeping their feet shoulder-width apart and slightly bent at the knees, with a straight back. They hinge at the hips, pushing their hips back and lowering their torso to nearly parallel to the floor. The barbell remains hanging straight down from their shoulders, and they pull it up towards their lower chest or upper abdomen while keeping their elbows close to their body. The person also maintains control throughout the descent, ensuring that they do not round their back or use momentum to swing the weight. Overall, the execution of the exercise is precise and demonstrates good form.
