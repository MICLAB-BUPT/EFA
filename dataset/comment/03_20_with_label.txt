The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The person maintains a straight back and engaged core, which helps maintain proper posture and prevent injury. They also keep their chest up and avoid pulling the barbell too high, which is crucial for minimizing shoulder stress. Furthermore, they execute a controlled descent, ensuring that the weight does not drop quickly, thus preserving stability and reducing the risk of accidents. These aspects contribute to the overall good performance displayed in the video.
