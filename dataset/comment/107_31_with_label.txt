The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad. The individual does not properly transition into the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) and instead attempts to thrust forward without a stable base. This lack of stability can lead to an ineffective thrust and potentially unsafe execution. To improve, the individual should focus on maintaining balance and proper form throughout the technique, ensuring that the 'Gong Bu' is established before attempting any thrusts.
