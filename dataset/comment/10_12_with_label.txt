The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person lies on a decline bench with feet secured under the pads and eyes positioned slightly below the barbell when it's racked, ensuring a safe and efficient unrack. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using a full grip (thumb wrapped around the bar). The person unracks the barbell with arms extended, keeping wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked. They lower the barbell under control, touching it to the lower chest, and push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. Throughout the movement, the person engages the abdominal muscles to stabilize the torso, demonstrating proper technique and form.
