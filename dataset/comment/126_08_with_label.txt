The staff chop action in this video is good. The performer begins in a stable stance, with the Nangun held firmly and positioned for a downward strike. The body coils slightly to store potential energy before initiating the 'Pi Gun' ( pi gun ) motion. The downward striking motion is powerful and precise, driven from the ground through the legs and core. The non-wielding hand moves for balance and contributes to the downward momentum. The finishing position near the waist or thigh is consistent with the style and intended application of the technique.
