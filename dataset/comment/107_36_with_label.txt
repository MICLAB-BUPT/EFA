The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad. The character's shadow on the wall suggests that the lighting and positioning are not optimal for a clear view of the technique. The person is not wearing any protective gear, which is essential for safety during such practice. Additionally, the video does not show the proper execution of the technique, including the correct grip, stance, and footwork required to perform the move effectively. To improve, the person should ensure proper form, wear protective gear, and practice under appropriate lighting conditions.
