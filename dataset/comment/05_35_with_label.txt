The barbell glute bridge action in this video is bad. The woman's legs are not positioned correctly, as her knees are not hip-width apart and she has not placed the barbell across her hips. This incorrect positioning can lead to poor form and increased risk of injury. To improve, she should adjust her leg position and ensure the barbell is properly placed across her hips before attempting the exercise again.
