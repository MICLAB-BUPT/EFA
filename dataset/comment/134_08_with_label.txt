The nunchaku flourish action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a balanced stance, controlled wrist and arm rotations while swinging the free handle of the nunchaku in circular patterns. They exhibit continuous motion, transitioning smoothly between different planes of movement without interruption or pauses. Additionally, the character incorporates subtle body movements that enhance the flow and dynamism of the nunchaku dance. Overall, the execution of the flourish appears fluid and precise, with minimal room for improvement.
