The barbell deadlift action in this video is bad. While the overall sumo stance is generally appropriate, the athlete demonstrates significant technical faults, most notably the breaking of the neutral spine during the ascent, particularly in the upper thoracic region. This rounding compromises spinal stability under load. Furthermore, the athlete displays premature hip extension (hips rising too quickly) at the beginning of the lift, momentarily turning the movement into a stiffer-leg variation before she corrects it mid-pull. Her head position is also poor, as she looks up, hyperextending the neck and disrupting the neutral spinal alignment. To improve, the athlete must maintain a tightly braced, neutral spine (avoiding thoracic rounding) throughout the entire lift, ensure the shoulders and hips rise at the same rate, and keep the head in line with the torso by looking down slightly at the floor.
