The staff point action in this video is bad. The individual does not start in a stable stance, such as a horse stance or neutral stance, with a firm grip on the staff. Instead, they are seen holding the staff horizontally and then thrusting it forward in an uncontrolled manner. This lack of proper grip and starting position makes the action appear less precise and controlled, which could negatively impact the effectiveness and safety of the technique. To improve, the individual should focus on starting in a stable stance with proper grip and then execute the staff point with controlled, precise movements that generate power from the ground through the arms.
