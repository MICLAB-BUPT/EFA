The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual follows the recommended form tips by lying on a decline bench, gripping the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and unracking the barbell with arms extended. They also maintain a controlled descent to the lower chest and a firm push back up to the starting position. The elbows are kept tucked in, and the core is engaged throughout the movement, ensuring proper stability and protection of the shoulders.
