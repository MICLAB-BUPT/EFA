The staff lift action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a balanced stance with feet shoulder-width apart, ensuring stability. The grip on the staff is appropriate for generating upward force. The explosive extension of the legs and hips is executed smoothly, providing momentum to the upward motion. The arms are used effectively to control the direction and angle of the staff, moving it in a controlled arc. Finally, the character maintains balance and control throughout the entire movement, transitioning into the next technique seamlessly.
