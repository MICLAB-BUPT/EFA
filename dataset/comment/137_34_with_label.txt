The sword point action in this video is bad. The character makes a small, controlled step towards the target, but the wrist motion is not quick and snapping enough to emphasize precision and accuracy. The power should come primarily from the wrist and forearm, not a large arm movement. Additionally, the character does not immediately retract the sword tip after making contact with the target, which is crucial for defense and to prepare for subsequent movements. To improve, the character should focus on quick, snapping wrist motions and immediate retraction of the sword tip.
