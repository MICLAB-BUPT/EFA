The crushing staff action in this video is bad. The individual demonstrates a lack of proper form and technique, which can negatively impact the effectiveness and safety of the move. There are no clear indications of the correct stance or grip on the staff, nor does there appear to be any focus on generating power through the body's core. Additionally, the execution lacks fluidity and precision, which are essential elements of a well-executed martial arts technique. To improve, the practitioner should focus on establishing a strong foundation with proper stances, maintaining a firm grip on the staff, and incorporating powerful, controlled movements that engage the entire body.
