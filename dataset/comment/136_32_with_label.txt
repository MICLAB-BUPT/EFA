The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not smooth and controlled, originating from the core as they should. Instead, the thrust seems to be initiated with a jerky motion. This can result in less power and accuracy in the thrust. To improve, the character should focus on initiating the thrust smoothly from the core, ensuring that the arm extension is coordinated with the step forward for maximum power and reach.
