The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The man maintains a proper stance with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the dumbbells with palms facing his body and slight bend in the elbows. He keeps his core engaged, maintaining an upright posture throughout the exercise. His movement is controlled as he raises the arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. The lowering phase of the exercise is also controlled, demonstrating good technique for muscle growth and strength development.
