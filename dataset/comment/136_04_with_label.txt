The sword thrust action in this video is good. The character begins in a balanced stance, with the sword held in a relaxed but firm grip. They initiate the thrust by extending their arm forward smoothly and controlledly, originating from the core and extending through the shoulder and arm. Simultaneously, they step forward with the front leg, adding power and reach to the thrust. The player maintains a straight line from the back heel, through the hips and shoulders, to the tip of the sword, maximizing power and accuracy. Finally, the character completes the thrust with full extension of the arm and body, maintaining balance and control.
