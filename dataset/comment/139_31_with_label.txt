The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character starts with an unstable stance and lacks proper body rotation during the sweep. There is a deviation from the ideal step of initiating the sweeping motion from the waist and hips, as the movement appears to be initiated more from the arm. The blade angle is not consistent throughout the sweep, and there is a lack of control in the wrist movement. The stepping motion is also not coordinated with the body rotation and arm extension. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, initiating the sweep from the waist and hips, keeping a consistent blade angle, and coordinating the stepping motion with the body rotation and arm extension.
