The sweeping staff action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a stable stance throughout the movement. The person begins with a wide stance and swings the staff across their body, which lacks control and stability. To improve, the person should start in a horse stance or bow stance to provide a solid base for the sweeping motion. Additionally, the person should coil slightly to store potential energy before initiating the sweep, ensuring a fluid and continuous motion that utilizes power from the ground through the legs, core, and rotation of the waist.
