The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back and neutral head position throughout the exercise, which helps to avoid injury and maximize effectiveness. They also use proper grip width and positioning of their feet, ensuring stability during the movement. Additionally, they exhibit controlled lowering and raising of the barbell, which is essential for maintaining form and avoiding strain on the spine. While there is no visible evidence of swinging the weight or rounding the back, these are common issues that can detract from the quality of the exercise. Therefore, the performance shown in the video is well-executed and adheres to the fundamentals of the barbell bent-over row technique.
