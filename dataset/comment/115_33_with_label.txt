The staff flourish action in this video is bad. The character starts with a firm yet relaxed grip on the staff, but the subsequent movements are not executed with precision and control. The motions appear rushed and lack fluidity, which is indicative of poor technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a steady pace while practicing the 'Wu' and 'Hua' movements, ensuring that each motion is clear and distinct. Additionally, the character could benefit from practicing the basic movements slowly to build muscle memory before increasing speed and complexity.
