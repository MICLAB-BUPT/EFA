The barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The movement depicted is again a Barbell Skull Crusher (triceps extension), not a bench press. The primary technical failure in this triceps isolation exercise is the severe and uncontrolled flaring of the elbows outwards during the eccentric phase. This excessive movement shifts tension away from the triceps and onto the shoulder joint, which is biomechanically unstable for this load and increases the risk of elbow and shoulder injury. To correct this, the athlete must focus on keeping the elbows tucked close to the head and pointing straight up throughout the entire repetition. The lowering phase must be slow and deliberate, ensuring the only joint movement is elbow flexion to isolate the triceps effectively.
