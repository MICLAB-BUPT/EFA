The staff lift action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a balanced stance and grip on the staff, starting with their body lowered to prepare for the upward motion. They then explosively extend their legs and hips while lifting the staff, maintaining control throughout the movement. The execution of the technique shows good form and precision, resulting in a smooth and controlled arc for the staff.
