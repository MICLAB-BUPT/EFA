The staff point action in this video is bad because the person's form is not stable or controlled. The body is not in a balanced position, and there is no clear indication of generating power from the ground through the legs and core. This results in an ineffective transfer of force to the arms, making the movement less precise and powerful. To improve, the person should work on establishing a strong foundation with proper footwork, grip, and core engagement to ensure a more effective and precise execution of the staff point technique.
