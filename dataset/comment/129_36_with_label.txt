The spear crush action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a stable stance, and the grip on the spear is not firm but rather tense. This tension can lead to poor control during the thrust. Additionally, the character does not initiate the movement with a proper forward lunge, which is crucial for generating power and momentum. Lastly, the character's arm extension is not full, resulting in a less effective thrust. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, gripping the spear firmly but not tightly, initiating the movement with a proper lunge, and extending the arm fully during the thrust.
