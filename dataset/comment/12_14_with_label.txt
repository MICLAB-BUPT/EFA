The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad. The athlete utilizes excessive momentum and swinging of the torso (cheating) to initiate the concentric phase, particularly noticeable at the start of the lift. This reduces the targeted isolation of the medial deltoids and engages the traps and lower back. The dumbbells are also raised too high, well above shoulder level, which can impinge the shoulder joint. Furthermore, the eccentric (lowering) phase is too fast, indicating a lack of control and missing out on eccentric muscle building benefits. To perform a proper dumbbell lateral raise, the athlete must maintain a rigid, upright torso without any rocking or swinging. The dumbbells should only be raised to shoulder height (parallel to the floor), and the entire movement, especially the descent, must be executed slowly and under control to maximize tension on the medial deltoids.
