The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by setting up with the barbell resting across the upper back, maintaining a neutral spine and chest up throughout the movement, and using a stance width that allows for deep squats. Additionally, they brace their core to support the spine during the exercise. These actions ensure that the person maintains stability and control while performing the back squat, reducing the risk of injury and maximizing the effectiveness of the exercise.
