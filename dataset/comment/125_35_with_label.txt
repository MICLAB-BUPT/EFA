The staff parry action in this video is bad because the person's form and technique are not executed correctly. They start with a wide stance, which is not ideal for initiating a staff parry. The person's body is not properly aligned, and their movement is awkward and lacks precision. Additionally, they do not use the correct hand positioning or core strength to execute the parry effectively. To improve, the person should start with a more stable stance, align their body correctly, and focus on using proper hand positioning and core strength to perform the parry accurately.
