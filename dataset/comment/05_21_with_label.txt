The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual is lying on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart, which is ideal for performing the exercise. They position the barbell across the hips, resting it in the hip crease, using a pad or folded towel to make it more comfortable. The hands are placed on the barbell to stabilize it, ensuring a secure grip, and the arms remain relatively straight but not locked out, acting primarily to keep the bar from rolling. The person takes a deep breath and braces the core, engaging the abdominal muscles, as they should when performing this exercise. They drive through the heels, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees, avoiding hyperextending the lower back by focusing on achieving full hip extension. The person holds the bridge position for a brief pause at the top, maintaining glute engagement, before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control. Overall, the actions performed align well with the ideal steps for a proper barbell glute bridge, indicating good technique.
