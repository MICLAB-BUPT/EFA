The staff lift action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a balanced stance, with feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent to prepare for the upward force. They maintain control throughout the motion, extending their legs and hips while guiding the staff's upward trajectory. The arms are used effectively to control the staff's direction and angle, resulting in a smooth arc. The character also maintains balance and control after the staff reaches its peak height, ensuring a stable base for transitioning into the next technique.
