The spinning whip action in this video is good. The person starts in a stable stance, holding the handle of the whip firmly and extending it. They initiate the turning motion of the body, which is crucial for generating momentum. As they turn, they begin to swing the whip, using their body's rotation to control its movement. The person continues the turning motion and the swing, maintaining balance and control throughout the entire sequence. This demonstrates good technique and precision in handling the whip.
