The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form throughout the exercise, with a neutral spine and chest up during the descent, and drives through the heels to return to the starting position. The stance width is also appropriate for deep squats while maintaining balance. Overall, the execution of the back squat is well-executed, demonstrating good technique and control.
