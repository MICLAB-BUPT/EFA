The crushing staff action in this video is good. The character starts in a stable stance, holding the staff firmly and maintaining balance. They prepare for the 'Beng' (bursting or springing) action by coiling their body slightly to generate potential energy for the strike. The character then initiates the 'Beng Gun' (bursting staff) movement with a powerful upward strike, delivering force through the arms and core. The technique appears to be executed with precision and control, showcasing a strong foundation in martial arts movements.
