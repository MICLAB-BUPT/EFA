The wrist flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, which makes the 'Wan Hua' technique appear less visually appealing. Additionally, there is a lack of control over the blade, leading to an unclear pattern. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable and balanced posture while practicing the wrist movements with more fluidity and precision.
