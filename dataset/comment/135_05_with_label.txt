The downward staff chop action in this video is good. The individual maintains a stable and balanced stance, which allows for power generation from the legs and core during the motion. The person extends their arm holding the nunchaku and rotates their body to generate momentum, involving the hips and core for maximum power. The free handle of the nunchaku is brought down in a vertical arc towards the intended target, with the wrist remaining firm but not locked. The person makes contact with the target using the striking surface of the nunchaku, focusing the force effectively. Finally, the follow-through after impact helps maintain balance and control, showcasing a well-executed technique.
