The barbell bent-over row action in this video is bad. The character's starting position is not ideal, as they are not standing with their feet shoulder-width apart and maintaining a too straight back. This could lead to poor form and increased risk of injury during the exercise. To improve, the character should adjust their stance and ensure their back remains straight throughout the movement.
