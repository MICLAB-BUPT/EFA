The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad. The character is not standing with feet shoulder-width apart, which can lead to poor balance and muscle imbalances. Additionally, the character is not keeping the core engaged or maintaining an upright posture, which could result in poor muscle activation and potential injury. The elbows are not slightly bent throughout the exercise, which might indicate a lack of control and proper technique. Lastly, the character's form during the lateral raise is not ideal, as they may be using momentum or swinging the dumbbells, which would not provide optimal muscle engagement. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper alignment, core engagement, and controlled movements throughout the exercise.
