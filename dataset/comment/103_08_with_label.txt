The horse stance punch action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable and wide stance with deep knee bends, which are essential for balance and power generation. The hand positioning is also appropriate, with one hand chambered at the waist and the other in a guard position. The execution of the punch appears to be smooth and controlled, demonstrating proper form and technique. To refine their technique further, the character could work on ensuring that the arm extension is precise and the rotation of the waist is coordinated with the punch. Additionally, maintaining a consistent rhythm throughout the sequence would enhance the overall effectiveness of the horse stance punch.
