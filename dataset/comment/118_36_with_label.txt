The wrist flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, and the blade does not create a visually appealing 'flower' pattern. The non-wielding hand does not move in a coordinated manner for balance. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining control of the blade, creating clear, distinct patterns, and practicing different variations of 'Wan Hua' with increased speed and complexity as wrist flexibility and control improve.
