The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine, engages the core and lats, and keeps the bar close to the legs throughout the lift. He also maintains tension in the hamstrings, which helps in stabilizing the lower back during the exercise. The slight bend in the knees and proper foot positioning contribute to a stable base, reducing the risk of injury. The individual demonstrates control over the movement by lowering the bar as far as flexibility allows without rounding the spine or hyperextending at the top. Overall, the technique shown in the video is well-executed, making it an effective demonstration of the stiff-leg deadlift exercise.
