The bow stance punch action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance, with feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, evenly distributed weight, and hands in a guard position. They then step forward with one leg, bending the front knee to approximately 90 degrees while keeping the back leg straight with the heel on the ground. The front knee is aligned over the ankle, and the torso remains upright. Simultaneously, the character initiates the punch with the opposite hand of the front leg, extending the punching arm forward aiming for the target. The character maintains balance and control throughout the movement, using the power generated from the stance and body rotation.
