The crushing staff action in this video is bad. The character's stance and grip on the staff are not ideal, which could affect their balance and control during the technique. Their arms are not fully extended, and there is a lack of upward motion during the strike. To improve, the character should ensure they have a stable and balanced stance, grip the staff correctly, and fully extend their arms to maximize power and control during the strike.
