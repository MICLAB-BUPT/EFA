The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is 'good'. The person is lying on a decline bench with their feet secured under the pads, and their eyes are positioned slightly below the barbell when it's racked. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart using a full grip. They unrack the barbell with arms extended, keeping wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked. They lower the barbell under control, touching it to the lower chest while maintaining a roughly 45-degree angle to the body. They push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. The person also takes a deep breath and braces the core, engaging the abdominal muscles to stabilize the torso throughout the movement.
