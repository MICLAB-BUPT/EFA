The sword point action in this video is bad. The person does not initiate a small, controlled step or shift in body weight towards the target. Instead, they proceed with a large arm movement, which lacks precision and control. Additionally, there is no emphasis on using the wrist and forearm for power, leading to an ineffective and inaccurate strike. To improve, the person should focus on subtle movements and quick wrist actions, ensuring that the tip of the sword makes contact with the target with lightness and speed.
