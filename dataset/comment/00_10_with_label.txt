The pull up action in this video is good. The man demonstrates proper form and technique by starting from a dead hang, gripping the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and initiating the pull by engaging his back and shoulder muscles. He pulls his elbows down towards his ribs and maintains control throughout the movement, ending with his chin above the bar before slowly lowering back down to the starting position. There are no significant flaws or areas for improvement in this particular pull up action.
