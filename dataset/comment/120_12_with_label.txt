The elbow whip action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance while holding the handle of the whip firmly, preparing for the 'Guai Zhou' (elbow hooking or elbow-turning) action. As the whip moves, the character uses their elbow as a pivot point to redirect the whip's momentum, creating a sudden change in direction and adding a snapping motion. The character also effectively uses their wrist and forearm to control the whip's movement throughout the technique, ensuring precision and stability.
