The spear point action in this video is bad. The person does not maintain a balanced and agile stance, and the grip on the spear is not ideal. Additionally, the step or shift towards the target is too large and not quick enough, resulting in an inaccurate point. The person also fails to retract the spear quickly after making contact with the target. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining proper form, grip, and speed throughout the movement.
