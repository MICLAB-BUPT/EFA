The sword chop action in this video is good. The practitioner starts in a stable stance with the sword held firmly, then raises it above their head and executes a powerful downward cutting motion. The wrist and forearm control the blade's angle to ensure a clean cut. The movement appears to be well-coordinated and demonstrates good technique.
