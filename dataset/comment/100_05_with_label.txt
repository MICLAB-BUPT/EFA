The cloud hands action in this video is good. The woman maintains a neutral stance and begins by shifting her weight from one leg to the other, initiating a side-to-side movement. Her body turns slightly in the direction of the weight transfer, creating a gradual and continuous weight shift. Her hands move in a coordinated, circular motion, as if waving clouds, with one hand moving upward and outward while the other moves downward and inward. She passes her hands each other without crossing directly, maintaining a sense of connection and flow. The movement is driven by the waist (yāo), and she coordinates it with the weight shift. She repeats the 'Yun Shou' (Cloud Hands) movement multiple times, maintaining a continuous, flowing, and coordinated movement. Overall, her technique demonstrates good form and precision.
