The back flourish action in this video is good. The person maintains a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao, preparing for the 'Bei Hua' technique. They execute the circular or figure-eight motion behind their back with fluid and continuous movements, maintaining control of the blade at all times. The non-wielding hand moves in a coordinated manner for balance. The person completes the 'Bei Hua' and transitions into another technique or returns to a ready stance, demonstrating precision and control throughout the sequence.
