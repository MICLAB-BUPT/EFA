The sword point action in this video is bad. The person's movements are not fluid or precise, and the technique appears to be lacking in control and accuracy. To improve, the individual should focus on maintaining a balanced stance with a relaxed grip on the sword, initiating small controlled steps towards the target, using quick wrist snaps for power, making contact with the tip of the sword, and quickly retracting it after the point.
