The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine throughout the movement, which is crucial for avoiding injury and ensuring proper form. The barbell is kept close to the legs, reducing the risk of strain on the lower back. The knees are slightly bent, which allows for greater stability and control during the lift. Additionally, the person engages their core muscles, which helps maintain balance and prevent excessive lumbar flexion. These aspects contribute to an effective and safe execution of the stiff-leg deadlift exercise.
