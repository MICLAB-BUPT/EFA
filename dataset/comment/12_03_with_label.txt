The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The character stands with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing the body and maintains a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise. The core is engaged and the chest is up with shoulders back, avoiding slouching or leaning forward. The arms are raised out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, maintaining control and initiating the movement from the shoulders. The character focuses on lifting with the medial deltoids, leading with the elbows as if pouring water from a pitcher, and avoids using momentum or swinging the dumbbells. The lowering phase is controlled and resisted, emphasizing muscle growth and strength development.
