The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The woman approaches the barbell with her feet hip-width apart and the bar over the mid-foot, which is an ideal position for stability and balance. Her grip on the bar is also appropriate, with an overhand or mixed grip that ensures a stable and controlled lift. Additionally, she maintains a neutral spine throughout the movement by engaging her core and pulling her shoulder blades down and back. Her technique of driving through the heels, extending the legs and hips simultaneously, while keeping the bar close to the body, further enhances the effectiveness of the lift. Finally, she lowers the bar under control by reversing the movement, maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core. Overall, the woman's form and execution demonstrate proper technique and control during the barbell deadlift exercise.
