The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by lying on the inclined bench with feet flat, gripping the barbell at shoulder-width apart, and maintaining a straight back during the lift. They lower the barbell to their chest and push it back up, engaging their core throughout the movement. However, there is room for improvement in terms of adjusting the grip width based on comfort and biomechanics, as well as ensuring that the elbows remain tucked in at a 45-75 degree angle to avoid excessive flaring.
