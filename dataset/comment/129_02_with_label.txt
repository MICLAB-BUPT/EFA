The spear crush action in this video is good. The person begins in a stable stance, with a firm grip on the spear. They initiate the movement by stepping forward and extending their rear arm, which provides momentum for the thrust. The front hand guides the spear's direction throughout the thrust, ensuring stability and control. The person completes the thrust with full extension of the arm and body, maintaining balance and precision.
