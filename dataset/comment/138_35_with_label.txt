The tai chi sword stir action in this video is bad. The character performs the upward movement from the wrist and forearm but does not follow through with a smooth, arcing path. Instead of drawing a semi-circle in the air, the sword tip moves forward without much curvature. Additionally, the elbow remains overly extended throughout the motion, which is not ideal for maintaining control and precision. To improve, the character should focus on keeping the blade's edge facing the direction of the arc, using the wrist to control the angle and precision of the movement, and ensuring that the elbow remains slightly bent and not overly extended.
