The knife flourish action in this video is good. The person maintains a firm yet relaxed grip on the Dao (broadsword) throughout the sequence, ensuring control and precision. They execute controlled, circular motions of the blade with fluidity and grace, creating clear visual patterns that demonstrate skill and mastery. The stance is neutral and stable, providing a strong foundation for the movements. The individual's focus remains consistent, allowing for a continuous, flowing motion that enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of the technique.
