The scissor flourish action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a stable and balanced posture throughout the sequence. The movements are not smooth and rhythmic, and there is an inconsistency in the crossing or scissor-like motion of the Nandao. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a firm yet relaxed grip, ensuring proper wrist, forearm, and body rotation, and practicing the movement with consistent repetition to achieve a clear and distinct 'scissor' pattern.
