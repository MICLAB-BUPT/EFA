The sword sweep action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, with the body upright and centered. The movement is initiated from the waist and hips, rotating the body as intended. The blade is kept relatively horizontal and close to the ground throughout the sweep, maintaining a consistent angle. The stepping motion complements the rotation and arm extension, contributing to the reach and power of the sweep. The character completes the sweep with control, bringing the sword to a stop in a stable position. The technique is smooth and well-coordinated, with no unnecessary over-rotation or loss of balance.
