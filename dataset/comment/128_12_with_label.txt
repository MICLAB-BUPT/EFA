The staff lift action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a balanced stance, with feet shoulder-width apart, providing a stable base for the movement. The grip on the staff is close to one end, allowing for effective leverage and control during the upward lifting motion. The person slightly lowers their body by bending the knees before explosively extending the legs and hips to drive the force from the ground into the staff. The arms are used to guide the staff's upward trajectory, maintaining a smooth and controlled arc. The individual maintains balance and control throughout the entire motion, ensuring that there is no loss of momentum or stability. This combination of techniques results in a well-executed and refined staff lift.
