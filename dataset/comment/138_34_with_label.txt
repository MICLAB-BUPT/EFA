The tai chi sword stir action in this video is bad. The character's movements lack fluidity and precision, with the sword not following a smooth, arcing path as described in the ideal steps. The wrist appears to be stiff, and the elbow is overly extended during the upward movement. Additionally, there is a lack of power and control in the waist rotation. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a centered and balanced posture, ensuring the wrist remains flexible, and the elbow stays slightly bent throughout the motion. Practicing these adjustments will help achieve a more accurate and fluid execution of the 'Liao' technique.
