The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good.The character in the video starts by lying on an inclined bench, which is typically set between 30 and 45 degrees, with feet flat on the floor. The eyes are directly under the barbell when it's racked. He grips the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using a full grip (thumb wrapped around the bar). The grip width is adjusted based on comfort and individual biomechanics, but he avoids excessively wide or narrow grips. He unracks the barbell with the arms extended, keeping the wrists straight and the elbows slightly unlocked. He takes a deep breath and braces the core, engaging the abdominal muscles. He lowers the barbell under control, touching it to the upper chest (around the clavicle or upper sternum), keeping the elbows tucked in at a roughly 45-75 degree angle to the body, avoiding excessive flaring. Finally, he pushes the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. He exhales during the upward push and keeps the core engaged throughout the movement. Overall, the character demonstrates proper form and technique for the incline barbell bench press exercise.
