The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The character demonstrates the correct positioning by approaching the barbell with feet hip-width apart and gripping it just outside the legs with an overhand grip. They also maintain a flat back and engage their core, preparing to lift by taking a deep breath. As they initiate the lift, they drive through the heels, extending the legs and hips simultaneously while keeping the bar close to the body. The character continues to extend until standing upright with fully locked out hips and knees, maintaining a neutral spine throughout the movement. The barbell is lowered under control by reversing the motion, pushing the hips back first, then bending the knees, keeping the bar close to the body. These actions align with the ideal steps provided, resulting in a well-executed deadlift.
