The staff point action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a strong grip on the staff and maintains a stable stance, which are essential for executing precise movements. The positioning of the staff tip aimed towards the target shows an understanding of the proper technique. Additionally, the quick and controlled thrusting motion, along with the focus on maintaining balance and control, further highlights the skillful execution of the 'Dian Gun' technique. While the action is already good, minor refinements could include ensuring that the body remains more upright during the thrust to maintain better stability and power generation.
