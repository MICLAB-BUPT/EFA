The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The person stands with their feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing the body, which follows the ideal starting position. They maintain a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise and keep the core engaged, avoiding slouching or leaning forward. The person lifts the arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. The movement is controlled and initiated from the shoulders, demonstrating proper technique. Finally, the person slowly lowers the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control and resisting the urge to drop them.
