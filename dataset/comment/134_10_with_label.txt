The nunchaku flourish action in this video is good. The performer starts with a firm but relaxed grip on one handle of the nunchaku, allowing for free movement of the arms and body. The movements are controlled and continuous, creating a flowing motion as they transition between different planes of motion. The performer incorporates body movement to enhance the flow and dynamism of the dance, ensuring that the nunchaku is always in motion without becoming static. Additionally, the performer practices catching the free handle and transitioning into different grips and nunchaku patterns, demonstrating fluidity and control throughout the performance.
