The back flourish action in this video is good. The practitioner demonstrates a clear and controlled motion, maintaining a firm grip on the handle of the Nandao while performing the circular or figure-eight motion behind their back. The fluidity of the movement and the precision in the execution of the technique are notable. There are no visible flaws in the form, and the practitioner's stance remains stable throughout the sequence. To further refine the performance, the practitioner could focus on increasing the speed and agility of the movements while ensuring that the blade stays under control at all times.
