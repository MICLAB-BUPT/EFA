The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual starts with a firm grip on the barbell, positioned at shoulder-width apart and slightly closer to their body. They maintain a straight back and engage their core while pulling the barbell upwards in a controlled motion, keeping it close to their body. Their elbows lead the movement, ensuring that they reach chest level without overextending. Throughout the exercise, the individual maintains proper form by keeping the barbell close and using their shoulders effectively. This technique ensures a safe and efficient workout.
