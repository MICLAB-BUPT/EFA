The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad because the character's posture and form are not executed correctly. The character does not start in a preparatory stance, and the grip on the sword is not firm but relaxed. Additionally, the 'Gong Bu' stance is not properly established with one leg bent at 90 degrees and the other straight with the heel on the ground. Furthermore, the thrust is initiated without the correct rotation of the waist and forward momentum. To improve, the character should begin in a neutral stance, establish the 'Gong Bu' properly, and execute the thrust with power and precision while maintaining the 'Gong Bu' throughout the movement.
