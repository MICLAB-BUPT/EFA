The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The person starts by lying face up on a flat bench with feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other, which is consistent with the initial setup described in the ideal steps. The arms are extended straight up above the chest, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out, as instructed. The person keeps the upper arms stationary throughout the exercise, focusing only on the elbow movement, which is also in line with the ideal action. The person takes a breath and braces the core, keeping the torso stable on the bench, demonstrating proper technique. They lower the dumbbells towards the forehead (or slightly behind the head for a greater stretch) by bending the elbows, and then extend the arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement. Throughout the exercise, the person maintains control and keeps the upper arms perpendicular to the floor, which is another key aspect of the ideal action.
