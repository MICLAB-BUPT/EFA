The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by standing with their feet shoulder-width apart, maintaining a straight back, and using an overhand grip that is slightly wider than shoulder-width. They also hinge at the hips, push their hips back, and lower their torso until it's almost parallel to the floor. The person allows the barbell to hang straight down from their shoulders before pulling it up towards their lower chest or upper abdomen while keeping their elbows close to their body. Finally, they lower the barbell back to the starting position, demonstrating control throughout the descent. These actions indicate a well-executed barbell bent-over row, which can help prevent injury and maximize the effectiveness of the exercise.
