The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by standing with feet shoulder-width apart, maintaining a slight bend in the knees, and keeping the back straight. The barbell is held close to the body, and the elbows move out and up to the sides as the weight is pulled towards the chest level or slightly below. The descent is controlled, avoiding excessive stress on the shoulder joints. The person's posture and technique align well with the ideal standards for performing an upright row, making it an effective exercise that targets the target muscle groups while minimizing potential injury risks.
