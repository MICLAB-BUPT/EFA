The barbell deadlift action in this video is bad. The character in the first clip starts with an incorrect posture, bending at the waist instead of the knees, which could lead to lower back strain and poor form. In the second clip, another individual attempts a deadlift but struggles to maintain a straight back and proper grip, both of which are crucial for safety and effectiveness during the exercise. Improving these aspects would involve ensuring a proper grip, keeping the back straight, and focusing on lifting through the heels while maintaining control throughout the movement.
