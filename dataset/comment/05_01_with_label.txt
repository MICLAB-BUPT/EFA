The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person demonstrates the proper form by lying face up on the floor with knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. They also place the barbell across the hips and use their hands to stabilize it while engaging the core and bracing the torso. The individual drives through the heels, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the floor, maintaining a straight line from shoulders to knees without hyperextending the lower back. Finally, they hold the bridge position for a brief pause before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control. Overall, the person maintains a strong and controlled movement throughout the exercise.
