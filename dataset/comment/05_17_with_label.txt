The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The woman maintains a stable core and engages her glutes to lift the hips off the floor, forming a straight line from shoulders to knees. Her hands are placed on the barbell for stabilization, and she avoids hyperextending the lower back. However, there is room for improvement as she can maintain a more pronounced glute contraction at the top of the movement, ensuring better engagement. Additionally, she could work on lowering the hips back down to the floor with control rather than letting them drop quickly or touching the ground forcefully.
