The barbell front squat action in this video is good. The man starts with the barbell resting across his shoulders, close to his throat, supported by his anterior deltoids. His feet are slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and his toes pointed outward. He takes a deep breath and braces his core, creating intra-abdominal pressure to support his spine. He initiates the squat by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously, keeping his torso as upright as possible. He descends until his hip crease is below the top of his knee (parallel) or to a comfortable depth while maintaining good form. Finally, he drives through his heels, extending his hips and knees to return to the starting position, keeping his elbows high and chest up.
