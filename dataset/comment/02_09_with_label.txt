The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The person maintains a straight back and neutral head position throughout the exercise, which helps prevent injury and ensures proper form. The elbows remain close to the body as the barbell is pulled up towards the lower chest or upper abdomen, demonstrating effective use of core muscles. The controlled descent back to the starting position indicates a focus on maintaining balance and control during the exercise.
