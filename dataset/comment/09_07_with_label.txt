The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper grip on the bar, with their hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and using a full grip. They keep their elbows tucked in at a roughly 45-75 degree angle to the body, avoiding excessive flaring. Additionally, they lower the barbell under control, touching it to the upper chest, and push it back up to the starting position by extending their arms while maintaining core engagement. The person's feet are flat on the floor, and their eyes are directly under the barbell when it's racked.
