The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character begins in a balanced stance, but the execution of the thrust is not ideal. The arm extension appears to be rushed and lacks control, and the step forward with the front leg seems disjointed from the arm movement. This results in an unaligned thrust, which diminishes power and accuracy. To improve, the character should focus on a smooth and controlled extension, with the arm originating from the core and extending through the shoulder and arm. Additionally, the step should be coordinated with the arm extension, creating a unified movement. Maintaining a straight line from the back heel through the hips and shoulders to the tip of the sword will help maximize power and accuracy. Finally, the character should ensure that the tip of the sword is the point of contact and that the body is prepared to recover or transition into the next movement.
