The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The individual maintains a solid horse stance with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. The knees are deeply bent, and the core is engaged, which provides stability and power for the movement. The hands are positioned in a guard position or chambered at the waist, ready for the downward chopping strikes. The execution of the double chopping fists involves a downward motion with both fists simultaneously, generating power from the core and the downward movement of the arms. The elbows are slightly bent at the point of impact, and the fists are angled slightly downwards, ensuring precision and control during the technique.
