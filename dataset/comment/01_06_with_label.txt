The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual starts by lying on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, maintaining a stable base for the exercise. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, ensuring a consistent grip width throughout the set. The person unracks the barbell with proper technique, lifting it off the rack and positioning it directly over their chest while keeping their elbows at a 45-75 degree angle to their body. The individual then lowers the barbell towards their chest, maintaining control during the descent, and finally pushes it back up to the starting position, extending their arms fully but avoiding a violent lockout of the elbows. The entire sequence demonstrates good form and technique, allowing for an effective and safe barbell bench press.
