The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a solid grasp of the technique, with a secure and controlled grip on the Dao. The execution of the 'Pu Bu' (drop step) is precise, with the body bending correctly to shift weight onto one leg while extending the other leg to the side, maintaining balance and stability. The simultaneous performance of the 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action) shows fluidity and coordination with the drop step, using the body's core strength to generate power. The movement concludes with a controlled finish, showcasing a refined and polished form. Overall, the character's execution of the pounce step carrying knife action is commendable, reflecting a high level of skill and precision.
