The sword chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance with the Jian held firmly, which is a necessary step for initiating any sword movement. The preparation for the 'Pi' action involves raising the Jian to a high position, which is appropriate for generating power and control. The execution of the 'Pi' is executed smoothly and with precision, as evidenced by the clean downward cut and the proper transfer of power from the ground up through the arm. The finishing position is also well-controlled, indicating that the character has a good understanding of the form and technique required for this particular movement.
