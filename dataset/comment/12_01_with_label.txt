The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by maintaining a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise, avoiding locking them out. The core is engaged and the chest is upright with shoulders back, preventing slouching or leaning forward. The arms are raised out to the sides until parallel to the floor, focusing on the medial deltoids while avoiding momentum or swinging the dumbbells. The movement is controlled during both the upward and downward phases, ensuring effective muscle engagement and resistance.
