The cross drape red action in this video is good. The person starts by holding the rope of the Liuxingchui, which is a crucial step in executing the move. They then initiate the 'Shi Zi' pattern by swinging the Liuxingchui in a cross-shaped motion in front of their body, which is an ideal starting position for this part of the technique. The individual smoothly transitions into the vertical component, swinging the hammer head either upwards and then downwards or vice versa, showcasing precise wrist, forearm, and body movements. The horizontal component follows seamlessly, with the person swinging the hammer head across their body from one side to the other and back again, maintaining a taut rope throughout the sequence. Finally, the person combines the vertical and horizontal swings to create a continuous, flowing cross-shaped pattern, known as 'Pi Hong', adding a sense of continuity and artistry to the technique. Overall, the performer demonstrates good control, precision, and fluidity in their execution of the cross drape red, making it an impressive display of skill.
