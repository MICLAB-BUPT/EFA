The spear point action in this video is good. The character starts with a balanced and agile stance, ready to move quickly and accurately. The grip on the spear is similar to other techniques but is adjusted for greater wrist flexibility and control of the spear tip. The player identifies the target and initiates a quick, controlled step or shift in body weight towards the target, which is smaller and faster than a full lunge, prioritizing speed and precision over power. The player extends the spear arm forward with a quick, snapping motion, primarily using the wrist and forearm, akin to a flick or a jab, aiming to strike the target with the very tip of the spear. The player maintains focus on the target, ensuring the spear tip makes contact precisely where intended, showcasing accuracy of the 'point'. Finally, the player immediately retracts the spear after making contact, returning to a ready position, which is crucial for defense and preparing for subsequent attacks or movements.
