The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a balanced stance and the arm extension is not smooth or controlled, originating from the core. The step forward with the front leg is also not coordinated with the arm extension. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a straight line from the back heel through the hips and shoulders to the tip of the sword, ensuring that the body is prepared for the next movement.
