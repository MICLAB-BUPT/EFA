The barbell front squat action in this video is bad. The athlete displays two primary and interconnected flaws: a significant early forward lean of the torso and excessive knee travel over the toes during the descent. The early forward lean indicates a lack of thoracic extension and poor core stability, causing the bar to shift forward over the mid-foot and forcing the athlete to compensate. This excessive forward displacement of the knees loads the patellofemoral joint unnecessarily. Furthermore, the athlete is initiating the squat too quickly, losing control of the descent. To improve, the athlete must actively maintain a tight core brace and thoracic extension (keeping the chest high) to ensure a vertical torso. They should focus on driving the hips straight down while keeping the knees tracking outward over the feet, allowing the knees to bend without rushing the movement.
