The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual maintains a stable core, uses the glutes to lift the hips off the ground, and holds the position at the top with control. The person's hands are positioned correctly on the barbell, providing stability without locking out their arms. The focus is on achieving full hip extension, which suggests proper form. However, there could be slight improvements by ensuring the hips are not hyperextended and that the movement is fluid throughout the exercise.
