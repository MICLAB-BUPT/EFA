The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character starts by standing with one leg raised and the sword held horizontally, which is not an ideal starting position for a thrust. This position lacks balance and control. Additionally, when the character extends their arm forward to initiate the thrust, there is a lack of fluidity and power in the movement. The step forward with the front leg is also not coordinated well with the arm extension, resulting in an awkward motion. To improve this, the character should begin in a balanced stance, maintain proper alignment throughout the thrust, and ensure that the step and arm extension are synchronized for maximum power and accuracy.
