The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual starts with the barbell resting on their upper back, maintaining a neutral spine and keeping their chest up. They proceed to squat down until the hip crease is below the knee or to a depth that feels comfortable for them. The person then drives through their heels to return to the starting position while keeping a consistent back angle throughout the ascent. These actions demonstrate proper form and technique for performing a barbell back squat.
