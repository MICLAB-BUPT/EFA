The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person starts with their feet flat on the floor, lying face-up on a flat bench, and their eyes aligned with the barbell. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart using an overhand grip. They unrack the barbell carefully, positioning it directly over their chest with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle to their body. As they lower the barbell towards their chest, they maintain control throughout the descent. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position, extending their arms fully but avoiding a violent lockout of the elbows. This demonstrates good form and technique for the exercise.
