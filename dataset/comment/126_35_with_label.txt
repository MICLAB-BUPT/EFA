The staff chop action in this video is bad. The person starts with the staff held above their head, which is not an ideal starting position for a powerful downward strike. They also perform the chop without proper body coiling and potential energy storage, leading to a less effective motion. To improve, they should begin in a stable stance, prepare with the staff raised above their head, coil their body, and generate power from the ground through their legs and core before executing the downward strike.
