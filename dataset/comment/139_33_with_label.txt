The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character initiates the sweeping motion with an over-rotating body, leading to a loss of balance and control. This results in a less effective and potentially unsafe technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance and initiating the movement from the waist and hips, with the arm extending outward while keeping the blade horizontal. Additionally, the character should ensure proper core engagement and wrist control throughout the motion to maintain stability and power.
