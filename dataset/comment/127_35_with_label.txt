The staff throw action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not stable, with feet not shoulder-width apart or in a fighting stance relevant to  nan gun , which compromises power generation. The core rotation is not executed properly, and the arms are used as primary sources of power rather than levers for force amplification. The release moment is not precise, and the follow-through is incomplete, leading to a loss of balance and potential injury. To improve, the character should ensure proper stance, execute core rotation effectively, use arms as levers, and release the staff at the correct timing.
