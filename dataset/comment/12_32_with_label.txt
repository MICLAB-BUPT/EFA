The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise, which can lead to potential injury and ineffective muscle engagement. Additionally, there is no mention of keeping the core engaged or maintaining an upright posture with the chest up and shoulders back, which are essential for proper form and stability during the exercise. The character's posture and movement appear to be more focused on swinging the dumbbells rather than engaging the medial deltoids, resulting in an ineffective and potentially unsafe workout routine.
