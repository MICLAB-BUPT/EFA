The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form and technique by lying on a decline bench with their feet securely positioned under the pads, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top of the movement, and engaging the core and glutes throughout the exercise. The grip is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, ensuring a stable and controlled lift. Additionally, the person maintains a 45-degree angle to the body while lowering the barbell, avoiding excessive flaring to protect the shoulders. Overall, the execution of the dcline barbell bench press in this video is effective and demonstrates good fitness practices.
