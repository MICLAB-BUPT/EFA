The bow stance punch action in this video is bad. The character does not properly establish the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) by bending the front knee to approximately 90 degrees and keeping the back leg straight with the heel on the ground. Additionally, the character's torso is not upright, and the hands are not in a guard position as they should be. These deviations from the ideal form can result in decreased power and control during the punch, making it less effective and potentially more difficult to execute correctly.
