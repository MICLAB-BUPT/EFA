The crushing staff action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not stable, and the grip on the staff is not firm, which can affect the execution of the technique. Additionally, there is no clear indication of a coiling or loading motion before the strike, which would generate potential energy for the powerful upward strike. Lastly, the movement does not appear to be fast or forceful enough, and the body does not rise slightly with the upward motion as it should. To improve, the character should start in a stable stance, grip the staff firmly, prepare with a coiled body position, execute a powerful upward strike, and maintain balance and control throughout the movement.
