The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad. The character's execution of the 'Pu Bu' (drop step) and 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action) is not fluid or coordinated with proper form. The body's core strength and weight shifting are not utilized effectively, resulting in a less powerful movement. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance during the 'Pu Bu,' use the core for power generation during the 'Dai Dao,' and ensure that the movements are fluid and controlled to align with proper form.
