The left and right chopping knife action in this video is bad. The character starts with a poor grip on the sword, which could lead to less control and precision during the chop. Additionally, the transition between the left and right chops is abrupt and not smooth, indicating a lack of fluidity in the movement. To improve, the character should focus on developing a strong grip, maintaining balance throughout the sequence, and practicing smooth transitions between movements.
