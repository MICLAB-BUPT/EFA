The barbell front squat action in this video is good. The person maintains an upright torso, keeping the chest up and the elbows high throughout the exercise. They initiate the squat by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously, maintaining a consistent, upright torso. The person also drives through the heels to return to the starting position while keeping the elbows high and chest up. However, there is room for improvement in maintaining a tighter core during the descent and ascent phases of the exercise.
