The pull up action in this video is good. The individual grips the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, which is a common and effective technique for performing pull-ups. They start from a dead hang, ensuring their shoulders are engaged but not tense, allowing them to use their back and shoulder muscles effectively during the exercise. The person pulls their chin above the bar in a controlled manner, avoiding swinging or kipping, which helps maintain stability and form throughout the movement. Finally, they lower themselves back down to the starting position with full control, demonstrating proper technique and strength.
