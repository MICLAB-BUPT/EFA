The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form by keeping their back straight, core engaged, and chest up throughout the exercise. They initiate the lift with correct hand positioning, pulling the barbell straight up close to their body, ensuring that the elbows lead the movement out and up to the sides. The person reaches a controlled chest level before slowly lowering the barbell back down to the starting position. These aspects contribute to a well-executed barbell upright row, minimizing unnecessary stress on the shoulders and ensuring effective muscle engagement.
