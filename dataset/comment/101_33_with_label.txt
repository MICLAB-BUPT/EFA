The left and right shuttle action in this video is bad. The character starts by lifting one leg, which is not the ideal starting position for the shuttle movement. They then proceed to step diagonally forward with one leg, but their arms are not properly positioned to perform a ward-off and pushing motion. Additionally, the character's body turns toward the stepping leg, which is correct, but their posture and alignment could be improved. The character also does not complete the bow stance correctly, as the front knee is not bent over the ankle and the back leg is not fully extended. Lastly, the character repeats the movement on the opposite side without maintaining proper form. To improve, the character should start in a relaxed, centered position, step diagonally forward with both legs, perform a proper ward-off and pushing motion with both arms, maintain the correct posture and alignment, and repeat the movement on the opposite side while maintaining proper form.
