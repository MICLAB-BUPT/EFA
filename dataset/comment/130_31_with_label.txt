The spear point action in this video is bad. The character does not initiate a quick, controlled step or shift in body weight towards the target. Instead, they move their leg in an unnecessary manner before swinging the spear forward. This deviation from the ideal steps can result in a less accurate and powerful strike, as well as potentially compromising the balance and stability required for effective spear fighting. To improve, the character should focus on initiating a quick, controlled movement directly towards the target, without any additional, unnecessary motions.
