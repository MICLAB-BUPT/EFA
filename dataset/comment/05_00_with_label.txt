The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person is lying face up on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. The barbell is positioned across the hips, resting in the hip crease, which indicates proper form. They are using a pad or folded towel to make it more comfortable, adhering to the ideal standards for this exercise. The person's hands are placed on the barbell to stabilize it, ensuring a secure grip. Their arms are relatively straight but not locked out, acting primarily to keep the bar from rolling. The person takes a deep breath and braces the core, engaging the abdominal muscles, which is crucial for maintaining stability during the exercise. They drive through the heels, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees, avoiding hyperextending the lower back. The person holds the bridge position for a brief pause at the top, maintaining glute engagement, and then slowly lowers the hips back down to the floor with control, without letting the hips drop quickly or touching the ground forcefully. Overall, the execution of the barbell glute bridge in this video demonstrates good form and technique.
