The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper grip with their hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and uses an overhand grip. They unrack the barbell carefully, ensuring that it is positioned directly over their chest with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle. During the descent, they lower the barbell towards their chest while maintaining control and focus on using their chest muscles. Lastly, they push the barbell back up to the starting position with a controlled and steady motion, avoiding a violent lockout of the elbows.
