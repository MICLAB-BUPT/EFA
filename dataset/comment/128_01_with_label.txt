The staff lift action in this video is good. The character starts with a balanced stance, feet shoulder-width apart, and maintains control throughout the movement. They use their arms and wrists to guide the staff's direction and angle, ensuring smooth and controlled motion. The character also uses the legs and hips to generate upward force, providing leverage for the staff lift. Overall, the technique appears precise and well-executed, resulting in an effective and visually appealing demonstration of staff lifting.
