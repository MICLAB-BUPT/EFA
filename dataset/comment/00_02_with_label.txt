The pull up action in this video is good. The man maintains a proper grip on the bar, starting from a dead hang position with his arms fully extended and shoulders relaxed. He then proceeds to pull himself up using his back and shoulder muscles, ensuring that his elbows are pulled down towards his ribs. This controlled movement allows him to achieve a full chin-over-bar position without swinging or kipping. As he completes the pull-up, he slowly lowers himself back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the exercise.
