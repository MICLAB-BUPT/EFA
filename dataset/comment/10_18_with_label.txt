The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is 'good'. The individual starts by lying on a decline bench with feet secured under the pads, positioning their eyes slightly below the barbell when it's racked. They grip the barbell with a full grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and unrack the barbell with arms extended while maintaining core engagement. The individual lowers the barbell under control to the lower chest, keeping elbows tucked in and the torso stable. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position, extending the arms and maintaining core engagement throughout the movement.
