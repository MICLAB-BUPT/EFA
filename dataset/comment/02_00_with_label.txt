The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper form throughout the exercise, starting with their feet shoulder-width apart and slightly bending their knees while keeping their back straight. They hinge at the hips, push their hips back, and lower their torso until it's almost parallel to the floor, demonstrating a controlled movement. The barbell is held with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width, and the elbows are kept close to the body during the upward pull towards the lower chest or upper abdomen. The individual maintains control throughout the descent, ensuring that they do not round their back or use momentum to swing the weight. These aspects of the technique contribute to the effectiveness and safety of the exercise.
