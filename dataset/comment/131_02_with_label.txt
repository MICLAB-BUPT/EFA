The spear twist action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, with a firm grip on the spear that allows for both control and the necessary twisting motion. The contact point with the opponent's weapon is closer to the player's hands than to the spearhead, providing leverage. The player uses wrist, arm, and body rotation to execute the twisting action, maintaining constant pressure and control throughout. The force is applied smoothly and deliberately, avoiding any sudden jerks. Finally, the player completes the twisting motion by disarming the opponent, creating an opening for further techniques.
