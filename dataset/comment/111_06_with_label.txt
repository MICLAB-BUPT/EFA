The crushing staff action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance and demonstrates proper grip on the staff, preparing for the burst of energy required for the 'Beng' ( beng ) action. The execution of the upward strike with the staff is forceful and controlled, reflecting the ideal steps for generating power from the ground through the legs and core. While the video captures only a brief moment of the technique, it showcases the fundamentals of the form and indicates a strong foundation for further refinement.
