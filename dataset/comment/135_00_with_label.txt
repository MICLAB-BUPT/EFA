The downward staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins with a firm grip on the nunchaku, holding it at shoulder level and ready for a downward strike. His stance is stable and balanced, allowing him to generate power from his legs and core. He initiates the downward swing by extending his arm and rotating his body, which involves the hips and core, maximizing power. As he brings the free handle of the nunchaku down in a vertical arc, he maintains control over the movement, focusing the force through the striking surface. He makes contact with the target with the free handle, avoiding full extension of the arm to prevent injury. Finally, he follows through with the motion, allowing the nunchaku to continue its natural arc after impact, maintaining balance and control.
