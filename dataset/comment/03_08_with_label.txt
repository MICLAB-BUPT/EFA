The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form by keeping their back straight, core engaged, and chest up throughout the exercise. They also use correct grip placement with hands closer than shoulder-width apart. The movement is initiated correctly by pulling the barbell up with elbows leading the way, ensuring that the bar stays close to the body. The person continues pulling until the bar reaches chest level or slightly below, maintaining a controlled motion. These aspects contribute to a well-executed barbell upright row, making it a good demonstration of the exercise.
