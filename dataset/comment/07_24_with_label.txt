The barbell back squat action in this video is 'good'. The individual starts with the barbell positioned on their upper back, maintaining a neutral spine and keeping the chest up. They execute the squat by simultaneously bending at the hips and knees, and drive through the heels to return to the starting position. Their stance is wider than shoulder-width apart, and they maintain a consistent back angle throughout the movement. The person also braces their core during the descent and maintains good form throughout the exercise.
