The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The character starts by assuming a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ), with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. Knees are deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground, back straight, and core engaged. The hands are positioned as described, with one hand performing the 'Lou Shou' ( lou shou , scooping/raking hand) and the other hand in a guard position. The character initiates the 'Lou Shou' movement, sweeping, scooping, or raking the hand from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards, using the power generated from the 'Ma Bu' and the rotation of the waist. The arm is relaxed but firm, and the movement is controlled and fluid. Finally, the character completes the 'Lou Shou' and transitions into another technique, maintaining the 'Ma Bu' throughout the movement.
