The spear crush action in this video is good. The person begins in a stable stance, which allows for forward lunging and power generation. They initiate the movement by stepping forward with the front leg and simultaneously extending the rear arm forward, driving the spearhead in a straight line towards the target. The front hand guides the spear, ensuring the point remains on target throughout the thrust. The person completes the thrust with full extension of the arm and body, maintaining balance and control. These actions align with the ideal standards for a spear crush, making it a well-executed technique.
