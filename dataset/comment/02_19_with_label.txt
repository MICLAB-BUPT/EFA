The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by standing with their feet shoulder-width apart, holding the barbell with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, and bending at the hips to lower the torso almost parallel to the floor while maintaining a straight back and neutral head position. They also let the barbell hang straight down from their shoulders before pulling it up towards their lower chest or upper abdomen with elbows close to their body. Finally, they lower the barbell back to the starting position slowly, maintaining control throughout the descent. These actions showcase good technique and precision, which contribute to the overall effectiveness of the exercise.
