The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form throughout the exercise, with a focus on keeping the elbows tucked in at a roughly 45-75 degree angle to the body and avoiding excessive flaring. This helps maintain stability and reduces the risk of injury. Additionally, the person engages their core during the exercise, which aids in proper posture and balance. While the individual's grip width is not explicitly shown, it appears to be appropriate for the exercise. To further enhance performance, the individual could ensure that they maintain a steady pace and controlled movements, focusing on the quality of each repetition rather than the speed.
