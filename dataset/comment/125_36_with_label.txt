The staff parry action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and controlled, and the stance is not stable or balanced. The execution of the 'Bo Gun' is not quick or sharp, which suggests a lack of precision and timing. Additionally, the transition between techniques appears rushed and lacks fluidity. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable and balanced stance, practicing precise and controlled movements, and developing a smoother transition between techniques.
