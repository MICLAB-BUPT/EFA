The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The woman maintains a slight bend in her elbows throughout the exercise, avoiding locking them out. She also keeps her core engaged and maintains an upright posture with her chest up and shoulders back, avoiding slouching or leaning forward. Her arms are raised out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor (or slightly below), focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. The movement is controlled, initiated from the shoulders, and she slowly lowers the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control and resisting the urge to drop them.
