The scissor flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid or precise, and the technique lacks control and balance. The hand positions are not optimal for executing a proper scissor flourish, which can lead to ineffective and unimpressive results. To improve, the character should focus on developing better hand positioning, wrist movement, and body rotation to create a more visually appealing and technically sound scissor flourish.
