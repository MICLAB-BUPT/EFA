The downward staff chop action in this video is good. The individual begins with a firm grip on the nunchaku, maintaining a stable stance throughout the movement. They initiate the downward swing by extending the arm and rotating their body, generating momentum effectively. The free handle of the nunchaku is brought down in a vertical arc, aiming for the intended target, with the wrist remaining firm but not locked. The person makes contact with the target with the free handle, focusing the force through the striking surface. After impact, the individual follows through with the motion, allowing the nunchaku to continue its natural arc. The technique appears to be well-executed, with minimal errors or deviations from the ideal steps provided.
