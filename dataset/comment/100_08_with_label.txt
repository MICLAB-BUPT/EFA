The cloud hands action in this video is good. The person maintains a balanced stance with their feet apart, knees slightly bent, and body centered throughout the sequence. They shift their weight smoothly from one leg to the other while performing coordinated hand movements that resemble cloud waves. The hands move in a continuous circular motion, passing each other without crossing directly, which is an essential aspect of Tai Chi practice. Additionally, the person's eyes follow the upper hand, demonstrating focus and awareness. While there are no major flaws, minor refinements could be made to enhance the fluidity and precision of the movements, such as maintaining a more uniform speed and ensuring the weight shifts are smooth and controlled.
