The staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, providing a solid foundation for the powerful downward strike. The grip on the Nangun (Southern Staff) is firm and well-controlled, ensuring precision and leverage during the movement. The preparation for the 'Pi' action involves raising the Nangun above the head or shoulder, positioning it for a downward strike. The body coils slightly to store potential energy, demonstrating proper technique. The execution of the 'Pi Gun' involves driving the Nangun downwards with force and precision, generating power from the ground through the legs and core. The transition to the next movement is smooth and controlled, showcasing skill and experience. Overall, the character's form and technique are well-executed, making the staff chop action in this video excellent.
