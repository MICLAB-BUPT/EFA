The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person is lying on a decline bench with their feet secured under the pads, which is an ideal setup for this exercise. They are gripping the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, which helps maintain stability and reduces strain on the shoulders. The person unracks the barbell with arms extended and takes a deep breath before lowering it to the lower chest, demonstrating proper control and technique. They push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending their arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. Overall, the person's form and execution of the dcline barbell bench press are excellent, making it a well-performed exercise.
