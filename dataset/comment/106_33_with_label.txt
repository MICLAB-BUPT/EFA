The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad because the child's movements are not fluid and controlled, which is crucial for executing the 'Chan Tou' properly. The child's wrist and forearm movements are not coordinated with the body rotation, and the blade of the Dao does not maintain a close distance to the head without making contact. Additionally, the child's stance is not stable, as the knees are not bent at 90 degrees, which compromises balance and form. To improve, the child should focus on maintaining a stable 'Gong Bu' stance, ensuring the wrist and forearm movements are fluid and coordinated with body rotation, and keeping the blade close to the head without making contact.
