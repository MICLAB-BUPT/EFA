The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad because the woman does not maintain a slight bend in her elbows throughout the exercise. This can lead to muscle strain and improper muscle engagement, potentially causing injury or suboptimal workout results. To improve, she should ensure that her elbows are slightly bent during the entire movement, focusing on raising the arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor (or slightly below) while maintaining control and using the medial deltoids.
