The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad. The character starts by holding the sword horizontally with both hands, which is not ideal for a thrusting motion. In an ideal form, the sword should be held vertically before being thrust forward. Additionally, the character's posture does not fully engage the body, and the footwork is not clearly visible. To improve, the character should begin by holding the sword vertically, execute the thrust with proper body rotation and arm extension, and maintain balance throughout the movement.
