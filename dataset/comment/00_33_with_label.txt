The pull up action in this video is bad. While the athlete achieves full range of motion by clearing the chin over the bar, the initial setup and subsequent execution display significant technical flaws. The primary fault is the use of a drastically wide grip, which places undue stress on the shoulder joints and rotator cuffs, potentially compromising long-term joint health. Furthermore, the athlete exhibits a strong arch in the lower back (lumbar hyperextension) during the pull, indicating a failure to maintain core rigidity and a reliance on compensatory movement to achieve the peak contraction. To correct this, the athlete must immediately narrow the grip to roughly 1.5 times shoulder width. They should also consciously engage the glutes and abdominals to achieve a neutral spine or slight hollow body position throughout the entire repetition, ensuring the movement is driven purely by the back muscles.
