The staff flourish action in this video is bad. The character's grip on the staff is not firm enough, and the stance appears to be neutral but lacks stability. The execution of the 'Wu' (dance) movement is not smooth or controlled, with visible hesitations and lack of fluidity. The figure-eight motions are not clear or distinct, indicating a lack of focus on creating the 'Hua' (flower). Additionally, the non-wielding hand does not move in coordination with the staff, which can affect balance and visual appeal. To improve, the character should practice a firmer grip, maintain a stable stance, execute smoother and more controlled movements, and ensure that the non-wielding hand moves in harmony with the staff.
