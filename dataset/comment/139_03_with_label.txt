The sword sweep action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance with the sword held firmly, initiates the sweeping motion from the waist and hips, and keeps the blade relatively horizontal while rotating the body. The movement appears to be smooth and controlled, with the arm extending outward as the body rotates, indicating good coordination between the body rotation and arm extension. The stepping motion is also well-coordinated, contributing to the overall stability and power of the sweep. The character's core engagement provides stability throughout the movement, and the wrist maintains firmness without locking, which ensures control of the sword's path. The final position is stable, allowing for a quick transition to another technique.
