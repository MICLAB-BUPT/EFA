The rope slide action in this video is good. The character maintains a secure grip on the rope, ensuring smooth and controlled movement. They execute the 'Liu Sheng' action with precision, allowing the rope to slide through their hand while keeping control of the hammer head. The technique appears fluid and well-practiced, demonstrating a good level of proficiency in handling the Liuxingchui (meteor hammer).
