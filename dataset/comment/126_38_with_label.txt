The staff chop action in this video is bad. The character starts by holding the staff above his head, which is not an ideal starting position as it lacks a stable stance. The body does not coil or store potential energy before initiating the downward strike, resulting in a less powerful and controlled movement. The execution of the 'Pi Gun' also appears to be rushed, with insufficient force and precision. To improve, the character should start with a stable stance, coil the body to generate power, and execute the downward strike with proper control and force.
