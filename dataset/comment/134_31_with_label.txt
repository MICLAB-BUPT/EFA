The nunchaku flourish action in this video is bad because the person does not start with a firm but relaxed grip on one handle of the nunchaku. Instead, they hold both handles loosely and swing them in a non-controlled manner. The movements are not continuous or fluid, as the person lacks balance and control over their arms and body. To improve, the person should focus on developing a strong foundation with proper grip and control before attempting more complex movements.
