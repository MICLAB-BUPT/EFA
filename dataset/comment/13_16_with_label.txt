The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a proper form by lying face up on the bench with feet flat on the floor, holding dumbbells with palms facing each other and extending arms straight up above the chest while keeping a slight bend in the elbows. The upper arms remain stationary throughout the exercise, and the only movement occurs at the elbow joint as the individual lowers the dumbbells towards the forehead and then extends them back to the starting position. This technique ensures proper muscle engagement and minimizes unnecessary strain on the spine.
