The tai chi sword stir action in this video is bad because the character's movements are not fluid and controlled, which is essential for a proper tai chi technique. The steps are executed with less precision and more force than necessary, leading to an unnatural and less effective demonstration of the form. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a centered and balanced posture, using subtle shifts in body weight and coordinated wrist movements to execute the technique smoothly and with control.
