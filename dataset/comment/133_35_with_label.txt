The spear flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, which is a key aspect of a proper spear flourish. The steps are not clearly defined, making it difficult to follow the intended pattern. Additionally, the character's grip on the spear is not firm or relaxed enough, which can lead to less control during the performance. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a balanced stance, using their wrists and arms to create smooth, continuous movements with the spear, and incorporating body movements that enhance the flow and dynamism of the dance.
