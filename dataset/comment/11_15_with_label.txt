The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The character in the video starts with an incorrect grip, holding the barbell with palms facing down and elbows not close to the torso. Additionally, the elbows are moving too much during the exercise, which can lead to poor form and increased risk of injury. To improve, the character should adjust their grip to have palms facing up and maintain a stationary elbow position throughout the movement.
