The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The person demonstrates proper form by standing with their feet shoulder-width apart and holding the barbell with an overhand grip, hands closer than shoulder-width apart. They keep their back straight, core engaged, and chest up throughout the exercise. The elbows lead the movement, moving out and up to the sides as they pull the barbell towards their chest level. The descent is controlled, ensuring that the weight does not drop quickly. These aspects indicate a well-executed barbell upright row, minimizing unnecessary stress on the shoulder joints and promoting effective muscle engagement.
