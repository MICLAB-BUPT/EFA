The staff lift action in this video is good. The individual starts with a balanced stance, ensuring a stable base for the lift. They then slightly lower their body by bending the knees to generate upward force, which is similar to preparing to jump and storing potential energy. The individual explosively extends the legs and hips upward while simultaneously lifting the staff, demonstrating control over the movement. The staff is lifted in a smooth arc, aiming for the desired position. Finally, the person maintains balance and control throughout the entire motion, preventing any loss of momentum or stability.
