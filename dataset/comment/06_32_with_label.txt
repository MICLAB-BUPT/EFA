The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a neutral spine, as they round their back while performing the exercise. This can lead to potential injury and is not recommended for proper form. To improve, the character should focus on keeping their back straight and avoiding any rounding of the spine during the lift.
