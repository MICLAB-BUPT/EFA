The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by lying face-up on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, ensuring a stable base. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip, which is ideal for stability and control. Additionally, they unrack the barbell carefully and maintain straight arms during the descent. The person lowers the barbell to their chest while keeping their elbows at a 45-75 degree angle to their body, demonstrating correct technique. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the motion. The individual's controlled and steady pressing motion, focusing on using chest muscles, further enhances the quality of their performance.
