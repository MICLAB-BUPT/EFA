The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a proper form and technique by lying on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, maintaining a stable base. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart using an overhand grip, which is ideal for chest development. The person unracks the barbell carefully, ensuring it's positioned directly over their chest with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle to their body. As they lower the barbell towards their chest, they maintain control throughout the descent, which is crucial for preventing injury and maximizing muscle engagement. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position, extending their arms fully but avoiding excessive lockout of the elbows. This controlled and steady pressing motion helps emphasize chest muscles. Overall, the individual exhibits good form and technique, making this a well-executed barbell bench press.
