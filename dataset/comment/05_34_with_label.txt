The barbell glute bridge action in this video is bad. The individual does not lie face up on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Instead, they are lying on their back with their legs elevated, which can lead to poor form and increased risk of injury. The barbell should be positioned across the hips, resting it in the hip crease, using a pad or folded towel for comfort. Additionally, the individual's hands should be placed on the barbell to stabilize it, ensuring a secure grip with arms relatively straight but not locked out. The core should be braced, and the glutes should be contracted to lift the hips off the floor, maintaining a stable torso without hyperextending the lower back. The hips should be lifted until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees, and then held for a brief pause before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control.
