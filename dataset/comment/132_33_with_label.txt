The block, seize, thrust action in this video is bad. The person in the video does not demonstrate a proper stance at the beginning of the sequence, which is crucial for stability and readiness. Additionally, the execution of the blocking action appears to be rushed or not fully controlled, which can compromise the effectiveness of the defense. The transition into the seizing action seems abrupt, lacking precision and fluidity. Finally, the thrusting attack is performed with a lack of focus and power, making it less impactful. To improve, the individual should start with a solid stance, perform each action with controlled and deliberate movements, and ensure a smooth transition between techniques.
