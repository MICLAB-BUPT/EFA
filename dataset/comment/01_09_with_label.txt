The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person maintains a stable base by lying face-up on the bench with their feet flat on the floor. They also grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip, which helps to ensure consistent grip width for each repetition and set. The individual unracks the barbell carefully, positioning it directly over their chest with elbows at roughly a 45-75 degree angle to their body. During the descent, they lower the barbell towards their chest while maintaining control throughout the movement. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position, extending their arms fully but avoiding a violent lockout of the elbows, ensuring a controlled and steady pressing motion.
