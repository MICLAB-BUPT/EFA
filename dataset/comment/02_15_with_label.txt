The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The person maintains a straight back and a neutral head position, ensuring proper form. They also pull the barbell up towards their lower chest or upper abdomen with elbows close to their body, which is an ideal technique for the exercise. Furthermore, they control the descent by slowly lowering the barbell back to the starting position without using momentum. These aspects of the action contribute to its classification as 'good'.
