The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance, holding the Dao with a firm but relaxed grip. They transition into a 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with one leg stepping forward and bending at approximately 90 degrees while the back leg remains straight. Simultaneously, they initiate the 'Zha Dao' (thrusting action) by extending the arm holding the Dao forward. The thrust is executed with power and precision, driven by the extension of the arm and the rotation of the waist. Throughout the action, the 'Gong Bu' provides a stable base for the technique. The character maintains proper form and technique, showcasing a well-executed bow stance thrusting knife action.
