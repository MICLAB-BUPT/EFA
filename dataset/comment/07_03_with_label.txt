The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine, keeping the chest up throughout the movement. They use proper foot positioning and drive through their heels during the ascent, ensuring consistent back angle. These aspects contribute to effective form and minimize potential injury risk. However, there is room for improvement as the individual could maintain better core engagement by pulling the ribcage down and tightening abdominal muscles more effectively.
