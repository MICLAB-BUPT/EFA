The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a proper form by lying face-up on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, ensuring a stable base. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip. As they unrack the barbell, they maintain control and position it directly over their chest, with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle to their body. They then lower the barbell down towards their chest, maintaining control throughout the descent. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position, extending their arms fully but avoiding a violent lockout of the elbows. Overall, the person exhibits a controlled and steady pressing motion, focusing on using chest muscles, which aligns well with the ideal barbell bench press form.
