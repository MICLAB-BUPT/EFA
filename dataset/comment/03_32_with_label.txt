The barbell upright row action in this video is bad. The primary failure is the complete abandonment of the barbell path in favor of a lateral cable row action, making this a misclassified exercise. If the intention was a barbell upright row, the athlete's grip is too narrow, and they are pulling the implement away from the body rather than vertically along the torso. This outward pull indicates poor control and a focus on arm flexion rather than shoulder abduction. To perform a proper barbell upright row, the athlete must use a wider, shoulder-width grip, maintain a fully upright torso, and pull the barbell vertically up the body, stopping the lift at mid-chest level while ensuring the elbows track higher than the wrists to minimize shoulder impingement risk.
