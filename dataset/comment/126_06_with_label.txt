The staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins with a stable stance, providing a solid foundation for the powerful downward strike. They prepare for the 'Pi' action by raising the Nangun above their head or shoulder, positioning it for a downward strike. The body coils slightly to store potential energy before initiating the 'Pi Gun,' which is a powerful downward striking motion. The character drives the Nangun downwards with force and precision, generating power from the ground through the legs and core. The non-wielding hand moves for balance and contributes to the downward momentum. Finally, the character completes the 'Pi Gun' and brings the Nangun to a lower position, demonstrating control and precision.
