The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The person begins by assuming a solid "Ma Bu" (horse stance) with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward, and knees deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground. They position their hands, one performing the "Lou Shou" (scooping/raking hand) motion starting from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards, or from a lower position moving outwards and upwards, often in a circular or semi-circular path. The arm is relaxed but firm, and the movement is controlled and fluid. The specific trajectory and target of the "Lou Shou" are not explicitly mentioned, but it seems to be executed using the power generated from the "Ma Bu" and the rotation of the waist. The person maintains stability and power throughout the movement, returning the hand to a guard position or chambered position at the waist.
