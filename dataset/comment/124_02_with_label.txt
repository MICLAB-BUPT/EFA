The scissor flourish action in this video is good. The character maintains a firm yet relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao, and their stance appears stable and balanced throughout the performance. They execute the crossing or X-shaped pattern with controlled wrist, forearm, and body rotation, generating power and control over the blade's trajectory. The movements are smooth and rhythmic, and the transitions between the crossing movements are fluid. The character's focus remains consistent, and they maintain a clear, distinct 'scissor' pattern visually. Overall, the execution of the scissor flourish in this video is well-executed and demonstrates good technique.
