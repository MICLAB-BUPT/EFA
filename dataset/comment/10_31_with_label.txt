The decline barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The primary issue is the athlete's grip and bar path, which indicate they are performing a triceps extension (skull crusher) rather than a decline bench press. The hands are placed too close together, and the bar travels directly overhead toward the forehead/behind the head, engaging the triceps instead of the chest. A proper bench press requires a wider grip (approximately 1.5 times shoulder width) and the bar to be lowered to the mid-chest/lower chest. Furthermore, the athlete lacks core tension, evidenced by a slight movement of the hips during the eccentric phase. To correct this, the athlete must widen the grip, lower the bar to the lower chest, tuck the elbows to around 45-75 degrees, and maintain a rigid core and planted feet throughout the entire movement.
