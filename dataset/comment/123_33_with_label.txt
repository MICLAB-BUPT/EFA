The back flourish action in this video is bad. The individual does not maintain a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao, which is an essential step for executing the technique correctly. Additionally, there are no clear indications of preparing for or initiating the 'Bei Hua' technique, nor is there a fluid and continuous circular motion of the blade behind their back. The movements seem rushed and lack precision, which is crucial for maintaining control over the blade during the back flourish. To improve, the individual should focus on establishing proper grip, preparing for the technique with deliberate movements, and performing the circular motion smoothly while keeping the blade under control throughout the sequence.
