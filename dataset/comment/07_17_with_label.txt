The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The person maintains a neutral spine, keeps their chest up, and braces their core throughout the exercise. They also initiate the squat with proper hip and knee bending and drive through their heels to return to the starting position. There are no major deviations from the ideal standards, making it a well-executed back squat.
