The staff point action in this video is bad. The person starts by holding the staff in a way that their arms are not parallel to the ground, which can affect the balance and control during the technique. Additionally, the person's posture appears slightly hunched, which may limit the power and effectiveness of the strike. To improve, the person should ensure their arms are straight and parallel to the ground when initiating the staff point, and maintain a balanced stance throughout the movement.
