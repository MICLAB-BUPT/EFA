The staff point action in this video is good. The practitioner begins in a stable stance, maintaining a firm grip on the staff. They execute a precise and controlled thrusting movement with the tip of the staff, demonstrating focus and balance. After the 'Dian' (point) action, the practitioner quickly retracts the staff to a guard position, showing control and stability throughout the movement. There is no overextension or telegraphing of the strike, which indicates a well-practiced technique. Overall, the performance aligns with ideal standards for a staff point, emphasizing power generation from the ground and sharp, short movements.
