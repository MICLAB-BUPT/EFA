The back flourish action in this video is bad. The character starts with a grip on the handle of the Nandao that is not firm or relaxed enough, which could lead to difficulty controlling the sword during the movement. The stance is also not ideal as it may affect balance and control. Additionally, the circular motion behind the back is not fluid or continuous, suggesting a lack of practice or skill in performing the technique. To improve, the character should work on establishing a proper grip, stance, and fluidity in the movements.
