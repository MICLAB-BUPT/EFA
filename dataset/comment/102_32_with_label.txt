The bow stance punch action in this video is bad. The character starts with a preparatory stance, but the legs are not shoulder-width apart and the knees are not slightly bent. The weight distribution is uneven, and the hands are not in a guard position. In the next frame, the character steps forward with one leg, but the front knee is not aligned over the ankle. The torso is not upright, and the back leg is not straight with the heel on the ground. The punch is initiated with the opposite hand of the front leg, but the rotation of the body is not used effectively to generate power. The punching arm is not extended forward, aiming for the target. The non-punching hand does not retract to the waist or remain in a guard position. Finally, the character returns to the preparatory stance without maintaining balance and control throughout the movement.
