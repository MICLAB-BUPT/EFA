The staff lift action in this video is good. The character starts with a balanced stance, feet shoulder-width apart or in a relevant fighting stance, ensuring a stable base. They slightly lower their body by bending the knees, preparing to generate upward force. The character then explosively extends the legs and hips upward, driving the force from the ground through the body and into the staff. Finally, the character continues the upward motion of the staff, using the arms and wrists to control its direction and angle. Throughout the entire movement, the character maintains balance and control, even after the staff reaches its peak height. These actions demonstrate good technique and precision in performing the staff lift.
