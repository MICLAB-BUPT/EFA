The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not smooth and controlled, and the blade is not aligned with the target. Additionally, the step forward is not coordinated with the arm extension, resulting in an unbalanced movement. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a straight line from the back heel through the hips and shoulders to the tip of the sword, ensuring that the tip of the sword makes contact with the target.
