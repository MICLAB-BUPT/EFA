The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a proper stance with feet hip-width apart, gripping the bar with an overhand grip and maintaining a neutral spine throughout the lift. The person initiates the lift by driving through the heels, extending the legs and hips simultaneously while keeping the bar close to the body. They also maintain a straight back during the lift, ensuring proper form. The execution of these steps results in a controlled and efficient deadlift. To further enhance their technique, the individual could focus on refining their core engagement and ensuring that the bar remains close to the body throughout the lift.
