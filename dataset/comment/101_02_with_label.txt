The left and right shuttle action in this video is good. The individual begins with a centered, relaxed posture before shifting weight onto one leg to step diagonally forward and backward. They perform a ward-off and pushing motion with their arms, creating a diagonal line of force as they complete the bow stance. This alternating movement from side to side demonstrates the 'Zuo You' (left-right) aspect of 'Chuan Suo' (shuttle). While the performance is well-executed, there is room for minor refinements, such as enhancing the precision of the arm movements and ensuring a smoother transition between steps.
