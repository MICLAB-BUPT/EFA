The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The character starts with a proper grip on the barbell, maintaining an overhand grip with hands closer than shoulder-width apart. They keep their back straight and chest up throughout the exercise, which helps maintain good form and reduce the risk of injury. The character initiates the lift by pulling the barbell straight up, keeping it close to their body. Their elbows lead the movement, moving out and up to the sides, and they continue pulling until the barbell reaches chest level or slightly below. The elbows are higher than the wrists, which is ideal for minimizing strain on the shoulders. Finally, the character lowers the barbell back down to the starting position with control, ensuring a smooth and steady descent.
