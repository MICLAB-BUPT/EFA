The horse stance punch action in this video is bad. The character's feet are not positioned significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, and the toes are not pointing forward or slightly outward. The knees are not deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground, and the back is not straight with the core engaged. The chambered hand at the waist is not properly positioned, and the thrusting punch lacks the necessary rotation of the waist for power generation. To improve, the character should ensure a solid horse stance, proper hand positioning, and effective use of the core and legs during the punch.
