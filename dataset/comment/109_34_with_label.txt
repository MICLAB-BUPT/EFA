The knife flourish action in this video is bad. The character performs the motion in a way that does not follow the ideal steps for a proper 'Wu Dao Hua' technique. They do not maintain a firm yet relaxed grip on the Dao, and the motions are not controlled or circular as described. Instead, the character's movements appear erratic and lack the fluidity required for an effective demonstration of the technique. To improve, the character should focus on creating clear, distinct patterns with the blade while maintaining control and stability in their movements.
