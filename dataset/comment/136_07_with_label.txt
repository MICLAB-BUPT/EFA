The sword thrust action in this video is good. The character begins in a balanced stance with the sword held with a relaxed grip, which allows for forward lunging and stability. The thrust is initiated smoothly, originating from the core and extending through the arm. The step forward with the front leg adds power and reach to the thrust, coordinating with the arm extension. The character maintains a straight line from the back heel to the tip of the sword, maximizing power and accuracy. The completion of the thrust includes full extension of the arm and body, with the tip of the sword being the point of contact, and the body prepared to recover or transition into the next movement. These aspects demonstrate good technique and control, resulting in an effective and powerful thrust.
