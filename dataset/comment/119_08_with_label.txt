The spinning whip action in this video is good. The character starts in a stable stance, holding the handle of the Jiujiebian firmly in one hand, with the whip chain extended and ready to be deployed. They initiate the 'Fan Shen' ( fan shen ) turning of the body using their legs and core strength to generate momentum. As they turn, they begin to swing the Jiujiebian, using their body's rotation to generate initial force for the whip's movement. The character continues the turning motion and the swing, controlling the trajectory of the whip while maintaining balance and control throughout the entire sequence.
