The spinning whip action in this video is bad. The character starts in an unstable stance, holding the whip loosely, which makes it difficult to control the whip's momentum. During the turn, the character's body movement is not smooth, and they struggle to maintain balance. The execution of the whip swing lacks precision and control, resulting in an ineffective strike. To improve, the character should start with a stable stance, ensure the whip is securely held, and perform a controlled rotation while swinging the whip in a fluid motion.
