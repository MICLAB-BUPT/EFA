The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The character starts with a wide grip, which is not ideal as it may lead to less control over the weight. Additionally, the elbows are not close to the torso, which can cause unnecessary strain on the shoulders and neck. The core is not engaged, which means that the movement is not being stabilized effectively. The character also does not keep the wrists straight while curling the barbell, which can lead to wrist injury. Lastly, the character drops the weight abruptly after completing the curl, which can put stress on the joints and increase the risk of injury. To improve this exercise, the character should adjust their grip to be slightly wider but not too wide, keep the elbows close to the torso, engage the core, and maintain a controlled descent with the barbell.
