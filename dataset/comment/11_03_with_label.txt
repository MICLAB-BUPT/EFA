The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The man starts by standing with his feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell with an underhand grip. His elbows are close to his torso, and he maintains control throughout the movement. He curls the barbell upwards towards his shoulders by flexing his elbows while keeping his wrists straight. The man also lowers the barbell back to the starting position slowly, maintaining control. There are no major refinements needed as all the steps of the ideal action are followed accurately.
