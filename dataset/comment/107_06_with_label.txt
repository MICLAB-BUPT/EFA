The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is good. The person begins in a preparatory stance, holding the Dao with a firm but relaxed grip. They transition into a 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) by stepping forward and bending one knee while keeping the other leg straight. Simultaneously, they initiate the 'Zha Dao' (thrusting action) by extending their arm holding the Dao forward. The thrust is executed with power and precision, driven by the extension of the arm, the rotation of the waist, and the forward momentum of the 'Gong Bu.' The person maintains the 'Gong Bu' throughout, providing a stable base for the movement. Overall, the action is well-executed, demonstrating proper technique and form.
