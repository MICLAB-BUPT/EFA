The elbow whip action in this video is bad. The person starts with an incorrect stance and grip on the whip, which is not optimal for executing the technique effectively. Additionally, their body posture and positioning do not align with proper form, making it difficult to control the whip's movement. To improve, they should start with a stable stance, hold the whip correctly, and focus on maintaining good control over the whip throughout the motion.
