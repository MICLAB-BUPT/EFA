The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is good. The individual begins in a preparatory stance, with the Dao held firmly and relaxedly. They transition into a 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with one leg forward and the other back, maintaining balance and alignment. Simultaneously, they initiate the 'Zha Dao' (thrusting action) by extending the arm holding the Dao forward with power and precision. The individual then retracts the Dao back to a guard position while maintaining the 'Gong Bu' throughout. The actions are fluid, well-coordinated, and executed with control, demonstrating a good understanding of the technique.
