The pull up action in this video is good. The man starts from a dead hang with his arms fully extended and shoulders relaxed, which is an ideal starting position. He grips the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, demonstrating proper hand placement. As he begins the pull-up, he engages his back and shoulder muscles, pulling his shoulder blades down and back, which indicates good form. He continues to pull until his chin is above the bar, showing control throughout the movement. Finally, he slowly lowers himself back down to the starting position with full control, completing the exercise without swinging or kipping. Overall, the man demonstrates good technique and strength during the pull-up.
