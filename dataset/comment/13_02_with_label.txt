The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual starts by lying face up on a flat bench with their feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other, and extending their arms straight up above the chest, keeping a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. They maintain the upper arms stationary throughout the exercise while focusing on the movement at the elbow joint. The person takes a breath and braces their core, ensuring a stable torso on the bench and avoiding excessive arching of the lower back. As they lower the dumbbells towards the forehead (or slightly behind the head for a greater stretch), they maintain control and keep the upper arms perpendicular to the floor. Finally, they extend the arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement, and exhaling during the upward push, without locking out the elbows. This sequence of actions demonstrates proper technique and form for performing the laying dumbbell triceps extension exercise.
