The cross drape red action in this video is bad because the person does not swing the Liuxingchui in a controlled manner. The wrist, forearm, and body movement are not used to control the trajectory and momentum of the hammer. The rope is not kept taut, and the movement is not smooth or precise. Additionally, there is no sense of continuity or artistry in the technique, making it difficult to follow the pattern of the cross-shaped movement. To improve, the person should practice swinging the Liuxingchui with proper control and precision, keeping the rope taut, and adding a sense of continuity and artistry to the technique.
