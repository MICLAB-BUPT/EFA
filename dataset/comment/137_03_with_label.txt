The sword point action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a balanced and agile stance, holding the sword with a relaxed grip that allows for maximum wrist flexibility and control of the blade tip. A quick, controlled step towards the target is executed, preparing for the rapid wrist action. The snapping motion of the wrist to flick the tip of the sword forward is precise and accurate, emphasizing the light and fast 'point' technique. The character also immediately withdraws the sword tip after making contact, returning to a ready position, which is crucial for defense and preparing for subsequent movements.
