The sword point action in this video is good. The person begins in a balanced stance, ready to move quickly and precisely with the sword held with a relaxed grip. They execute a small, controlled step towards the target, followed by a quick snapping motion of the wrist to flick the tip of the sword forward. Contact is made with the target using the very tip of the sword, demonstrating precision and accuracy. Finally, the person immediately withdraws the sword tip after making contact, returning to a ready position. These steps align well with the ideal standards for a sword point, emphasizing quickness, control, and accuracy.
