The bow stance head wrap action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance with the Dao held firmly, transitioning smoothly into a 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with a firm yet relaxed grip on the weapon. Simultaneously, the character initiates the 'Chan Tou' (head-wrapping action) with fluid and controlled movements of the Dao around the head. The motion is driven by the wrist, forearm, and body rotation, maintaining balance and coordination throughout. The finishing position of the Dao is also well executed, showcasing a refined technique that adheres to the ideal standards for performing the bow stance head wrap.
