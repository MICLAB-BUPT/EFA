The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person starts by lying face-up on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, providing a stable base. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart using an overhand grip, ensuring consistent grip width for each repetition and set. As they unrack the barbell, they maintain straight arms and position it directly over their chest, keeping their elbows at roughly a 45-75 degree angle to their body. The person then lowers the barbell down towards their chest, maintaining control throughout the descent, and finally pushes the barbell back up to the starting position, extending their arms fully while avoiding a violent lockout of the elbows. The video showcases a controlled and steady pressing motion, focusing on using chest muscles, which is indicative of good form.
