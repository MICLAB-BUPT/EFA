The spinning whip action in this video is good. The person starts in a stable stance, holding the handle of the whip firmly and initiating the turn of their body with a controlled rotation. As they turn, they begin to swing the whip, using the momentum generated by their body movement. The non-wielding hand assists in maintaining balance and guiding the whip's trajectory. The person completes the turn and strike with a controlled stop, demonstrating good technique and control throughout the sequence.
