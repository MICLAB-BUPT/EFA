The left and right chopping knife action in this video is bad. The character demonstrates a poor execution of the 'Pi Dao' (chopping action) by starting with an improper stance, lacking balance, and not transferring the weight through the legs and core effectively. To improve, the character should start in a preparatory stance, maintain proper balance throughout the chop, and ensure that the weight is transferred from the ground to the blade efficiently.
