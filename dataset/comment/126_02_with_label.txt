The staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, which provides a solid foundation for the powerful downward strike. They prepare for the 'Pi' (chopping or splitting) action by raising the Nangun above the head or shoulder, positioning it for a downward strike. The body coils slightly, storing potential energy. The character then initiates the 'Pi Gun' (chopping staff), driving the Nangun downwards with force and precision. The power is generated from the ground through the legs and core, transferred through the arms to the staff. The non-wielding hand moves for balance and contributes to the downward momentum. Finally, the character completes the 'Pi,' bringing the Nangun to a lower position near the waist or thigh. The specific finishing position depends on the style and intended application. The transition to the next movement depends on the form.
