The staff chop action in this video is bad. The character begins with a stable stance, but the execution of the chop is not ideal. The downward striking motion is not as powerful or precise as it should be. The non-wielding hand does not contribute to the downward momentum effectively. To improve, the character should focus on generating power from the ground through the legs and core, ensuring that the non-wielding hand contributes to balance and momentum.
