The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is bad. The character starts by lying on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, but they are not holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. They also have their upper arms stationary throughout the exercise, which is incorrect as the upper arms should be perpendicular to the floor during the exercise. Additionally, the character does not maintain control of the dumbbells and ends up with the dumbbells behind their head instead of above their chest. To improve this, the character should start by holding the dumbbells correctly, keep the upper arms perpendicular to the floor, and lower the dumbbells towards their forehead or slightly behind their head while maintaining control.
