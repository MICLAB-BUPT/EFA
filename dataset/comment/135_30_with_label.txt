The downward staff chop action in this video is bad because the person's form and execution are suboptimal. The person starts with an improper grip on the nunchaku, which is not firm or balanced. The body rotation is not generating enough power, as it appears to be a half-hearted movement. Additionally, the person does not follow through with the motion after striking the target, leaving the nunchaku to swing back uncontrollably. To improve, the person should start with a firm grip, generate more power from the hips and core, and ensure proper follow-through for better control and safety.
