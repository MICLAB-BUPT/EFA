The elbow whip action in this video is good. The character begins with a stable stance and firmly holds the handle of the Jiujiebian, positioning their elbow to pivot or redirect the whip's movement. They execute a swinging motion using the whip, with the elbow acting as a fulcrum for redirecting the whip's momentum. The wrist and forearm also play a critical role in controlling the whip's movement. Finally, the character completes the technique by bringing the Jiujiebian to a controlled stop, demonstrating precise control throughout the sequence.
