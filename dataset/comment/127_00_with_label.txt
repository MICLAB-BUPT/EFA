The staff throw action in this video is good. The person begins with a firm grip on the staff, initiating the throw by rotating their hips and torso to generate momentum. They extend their arms outward as the core rotation continues, releasing the staff at the precise moment when the force vector is directed towards the ground. The follow-through after releasing the staff helps maintain balance and prevent injury.
