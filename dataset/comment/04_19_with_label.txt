The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The man starts by standing with his feet hip-width apart and the barbell positioned over the mid-foot, which is ideal for balance and stability. He grips the barbell with an overhand grip, ensuring a neutral spine by engaging his core and pulling his shoulder blades down and back. As he initiates the lift, he drives through his heels, extending his legs and hips simultaneously, keeping the bar close to his body. He maintains a straight back throughout the movement, which is crucial for minimizing the risk of injury. The man then lowers the bar under control, pushing the hips back first, bending the knees, and keeping the bar close to his body, demonstrating proper technique and control. Overall, his actions align with the ideal steps for performing a barbell deadlift safely and effectively.
