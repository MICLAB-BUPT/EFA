The tai chi sword stir action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a centered and balanced posture throughout the movement. The body is not upright, and there is a lack of coordination between the upward arc and the subtle shift in body weight. Additionally, the wrist does not remain flexible, and the technique lacks fluidity. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a stable stance, keeping the body upright, and coordinating the movements with a smooth flow.
