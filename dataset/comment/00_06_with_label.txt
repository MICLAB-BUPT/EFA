The pull up action in this video is good. The individual starts with a proper grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and maintains a controlled descent from the dead hang position. The movement is fluid, with a focus on using back and shoulder muscles to lift the body. There is no unnecessary swinging or kipping, ensuring that the exercise remains effective and safe. The individual maintains a neutral head position throughout the movement, which helps in minimizing strain on the neck and promoting better form.
