The sword stir action in this video is bad. The person starts by holding the sword horizontally, which is not the ideal starting position for a Liao Jian. Additionally, their movements are rushed and lack control, resulting in an incomplete and unbalanced cut. To improve, they should begin with a neutral stance, ensure a firm but relaxed grip on the sword, and execute the Liao Jian with deliberate and controlled motions, focusing on power generation from the ground up through the arm to the blade.
