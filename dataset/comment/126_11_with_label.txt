The staff chop action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a stable stance, starting with the Nangun held firmly and positioned above the head for a downward strike. As the 'Pi Gun' motion commences, the power is generated from the ground, moving through the arms to the staff, resulting in a powerful downward motion. The transition between movements is smooth, maintaining balance and control throughout the sequence. The execution of the 'Pi' motion is precise, with the staff reaching a lower position near the waist or thigh, indicating effective technique. Overall, the character's performance is consistent with ideal staff chopping form, showcasing strength, precision, and control.
