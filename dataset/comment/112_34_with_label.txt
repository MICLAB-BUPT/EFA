The staff point action in this video is bad. The character fails to maintain a stable stance and instead leans back, which compromises balance and control. Additionally, the arm is extended forward with an excessive amount of force, leading to potential strain or injury. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper body alignment, using controlled movements, and applying appropriate force to execute the technique effectively and safely.
