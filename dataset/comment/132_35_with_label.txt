The block, seize, thrust action in this video is bad because the person's movements are not fluid or controlled. The spear is not being used effectively to control or deflect the opponent's weapon, and there is a lack of precision in the movements. To improve, the person should focus on practicing proper technique, including maintaining a strong stance, using the spear shaft for blocking, and smoothly transitioning into the seizing and thrusting actions.
