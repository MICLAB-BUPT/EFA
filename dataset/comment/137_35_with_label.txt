The sword point action in this video is bad. The character's execution of the movement lacks precision and control, resulting in a less effective strike. The initial stance is balanced, but the subsequent steps are not executed with the required subtlety and quickness. The wrist snapping motion is not as sharp and controlled as it should be, leading to an imperfect contact with the target. To improve, the character should focus on refining the wrist action for more precise and powerful strikes, ensuring that each step is deliberate and contributes to the overall effectiveness of the technique.
