The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by standing with feet hip-width apart and the barbell over mid-foot, which ensures stability and control during the lift. The hips are pushed back while maintaining a slight bend in the knees, keeping the back straight and neutral, avoiding any rounding of the spine. A deep breath is taken, bracing the core to engage the abdominal muscles and lats, maintaining tension in the hamstrings as the bar is lowered. The barbell is lowered as far as flexibility allows while maintaining a neutral spine, and the individual doesn't let the bar touch the floor. The motion is reversed by driving through the heels, extending the hips, and squeezing the glutes, maintaining the slight knee bend throughout the entire lift. Standing up fully at the top without hyperextension completes the movement.
