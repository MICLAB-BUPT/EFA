The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual starts by standing with feet hip-width apart and the barbell over mid-foot, with the shins slightly straighter than in a conventional deadlift setup. The hips are pushed back while maintaining a slight bend in the knees, keeping the back straight and neutral to avoid rounding the spine. A deep breath is taken, and the core is braced, engaging the abdominal muscles and lats. The barbell is lowered by pushing the hips back, keeping it close to the legs with a slight bend in the knees. The individual maintains tension in the hamstrings and feels a stretch as they lower the bar. Finally, the motion is reversed by driving through the heels, extending the hips, and squeezing the glutes, ensuring the back remains straight throughout the lift. The individual stands up fully at the top but does not hyperextend. Overall, the individual demonstrates proper form and technique for a stiff-leg deadlift, which is why the action can be classified as 'good'.
