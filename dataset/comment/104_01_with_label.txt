The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The person begins by assuming a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ) with their feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward, knees deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground, and back straight with core engaged. The hands are positioned in a way that allows for a sweeping, scooping, or raking motion of the hand, starting from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards, or from a lower position moving outwards and upwards, often in a circular or semi-circular path. The arm is relaxed but firm, and the movement is controlled and fluid. The specific trajectory and target of the 'Lou Shou' will depend on its intended application (defense, grabbing, etc.). The person completes the 'Lou Shou' and then transitions into another technique, maintaining the 'Ma Bu' throughout the movement, providing stability and power.
