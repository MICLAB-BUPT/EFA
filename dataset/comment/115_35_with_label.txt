The staff flourish action in this video is bad because the person's movements are not fluid and controlled, which can result in a loss of balance and control over the staff. The individual's stance appears to be unsteady, and there are abrupt transitions between movements, which may not produce the desired visual patterns or flow required for an effective Wu Hua Gun practice. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a stable and balanced stance while practicing smooth, continuous motions that demonstrate control and precision.
