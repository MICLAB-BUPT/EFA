The wrist flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, and the blade does not create a visually appealing 'flower' pattern. The upper arm is not relatively still, and the non-wielding hand does not move in a coordinated manner for balance. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining control of the blade and creating clear, distinct patterns with smooth, continuous movements.
