The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is bad. The character is lying on the floor with his feet flat on the ground, which is not the ideal position for this exercise. The elbows should be bent slightly to avoid locking them out. The character is also not keeping his upper arms stationary throughout the exercise, as they are moving in a way that is not aligned with proper form. This can lead to potential injury and decreased effectiveness of the exercise. To improve, the character should lie face up on a flat bench with his feet flat on the floor, keeping his upper arms perpendicular to the floor and his elbows slightly bent. He should also maintain control during the exercise, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement.
