The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back and engaged core throughout the movement, demonstrating proper form. They approach the bar with their feet hip-width apart and grip it just outside the legs, following ideal technique. The lifter also braces their core and engages their lats to create tension, which helps stabilize the body during the lift. As they drive through their heels and extend their hips and knees simultaneously, the bar stays close to the body, minimizing unnecessary movement. Finally, they lower the bar under control by reversing the movement, maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core.
