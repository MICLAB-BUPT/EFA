The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper foot positioning with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, knees deeply bent, and the core engaged. The hands are positioned correctly for a guard or chambered position at the waist, ready for the downward chopping strikes. The execution of the 'Shuang Pi Quan' involves a downward, chopping motion with both fists simultaneously, generating power from the 'Ma Bu' (horse stance). The elbows are slightly bent at the point of impact, and the fists are angled downwards. The individual maintains the 'Ma Bu' throughout the entire movement, providing stability and power. The sequence is fluid, with a focus on form and technique, which is characteristic of good martial arts practice.
