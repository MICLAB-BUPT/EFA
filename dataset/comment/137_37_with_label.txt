The sword point action in this video is bad. The person starts with the sword at a low angle, which is not ideal for a precise point. Additionally, the motion is not smooth or controlled, and the wrist does not snap quickly enough to make contact with the target. To improve, the person should begin with the sword held higher and at an angle that allows for a quicker, more precise point. They should also practice snapping their wrist more rapidly to increase accuracy and control.
