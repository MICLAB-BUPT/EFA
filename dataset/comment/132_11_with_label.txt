The block, seize, thrust action in this video is good. The person starts in a proper stance, providing a solid base and readiness for movement. They execute the blocking action by using the spear shaft to deflect or block an incoming attack, which is firm and controlled. Following this, they transition into seizing the opponent's weapon with the spear, effectively trapping it. Finally, the person performs a swift thrusting attack with the spear, aiming to strike the opponent. The recovery after the thrust is also well-executed, returning to a defensive stance. This sequence of actions demonstrates a well-practiced and fluid technique that achieves the ideal standards for blocking, seizing, and thrusting.
