The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad. The character's elbows are not bent enough, and they are not keeping their chest up and shoulders back, which can lead to poor muscle engagement and increased risk of injury. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a slight bend in the elbows and engaging their core throughout the exercise. Additionally, they should ensure that their chest is raised and their shoulders are back to maximize the effectiveness of the lateral raise.
