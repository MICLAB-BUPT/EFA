The staff lift action in this video is good. The individual starts with a balanced stance, ensuring stability before initiating the upward motion of the staff. The grip on the staff is appropriate, allowing for control and leverage during the lift. The body's extension through the legs and hips is evident, providing a strong foundation for the upward movement. The arms are used effectively to guide the staff's trajectory, maintaining balance throughout the action. Overall, the execution of the staff lift demonstrates proper technique and control.
