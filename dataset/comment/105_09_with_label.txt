The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The person maintains a solid "Ma Bu" (horse stance) with their feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. They keep their knees deeply bent, with thighs parallel to the ground, back straight, and core engaged, which provides stability and power. The person positions both hands in a guard position or chambered at the waist, forming fists ready for the downward chopping strikes. They initiate the "Shuang Pi Quan" (double chopping fists) by bringing both fists down forcefully towards a target in front of them. The elbows are slightly bent at the point of impact, and the fists are angled slightly inwards or downwards, which adds precision to the technique. After the strikes, they retract the fists back to a guard position or chambered position while maintaining the "Ma Bu," which ensures stability throughout the entire movement.
