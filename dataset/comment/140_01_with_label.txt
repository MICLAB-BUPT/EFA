The cloud sword action in this video is good. The person starts from a balanced stance, with the sword held in front of their body. They initiate the circular motion smoothly and maintain a consistent speed throughout the sequence. The wrist and forearm movements are coordinated to guide the sword through the circles, and there are subtle body movements that enhance the fluidity of the technique. The person's form remains upright and relaxed, with the core engaged, which adds to the overall elegance of the performance.
