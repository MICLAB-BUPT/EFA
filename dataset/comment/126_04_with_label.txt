The staff chop action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a stable stance and maintains a firm grip on the staff throughout the sequence. The preparation for the 'Pi' (chopping or splitting) action is evident as the staff is raised above the head, positioning it for a downward strike. The execution of the 'Pi Gun' (downward striking motion) is powerful and precise, with the staff being driven downwards with force. The transition to the next movement appears smooth and controlled, indicating a well-executed technique. Overall, the character's movements are fluid and coordinated, reflecting good form and skill in handling the staff.
