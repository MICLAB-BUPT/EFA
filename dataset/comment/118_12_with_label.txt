The wrist flourish action in this video is good. The character maintains a firm but relaxed grip on the Jian, and their stance is stable and balanced. The execution of the 'Wan Hua' technique involves rotating the wrist to create a visually appealing pattern with the blade. While the movement appears fluid and continuous, there is room for further refinement in terms of speed and complexity. The character can gradually increase these aspects as their wrist flexibility and control improve, incorporating the wrist flourish into transitions between other techniques or practicing it as a standalone drill.
