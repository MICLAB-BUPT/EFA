The barbell glute bridge action in this video is bad. The individual's form is suboptimal, as they are not maintaining proper alignment throughout the exercise. The hips are not fully extended, and the lower back is likely being overextended due to improper posture. To improve this, the person should focus on engaging their glutes more effectively, ensuring that their hips are level with their knees, and keeping their lower back neutral during the lift.
