The sword point action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a balanced and agile stance, ready to move quickly and precisely. They initiate a small, controlled step towards the target, preparing for the rapid wrist action. The quick, snapping motion of the wrist to flick the tip of the sword forward towards the target is executed with precision and accuracy. After making contact with the target, the character immediately withdraws the sword tip, returning to a ready position. These actions align with the ideal standards for executing a precise and accurate sword point, emphasizing control, speed, and agility.
