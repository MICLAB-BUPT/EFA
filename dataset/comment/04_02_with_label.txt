The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The person demonstrates proper form by approaching the barbell with their feet hip-width apart and maintaining a neutral spine while gripping the bar just outside the legs. They take a deep breath and brace their core, initiating the lift by driving through their heels and extending their legs and hips simultaneously. The bar is kept close to the body as it is dragged up the shins and thighs, and the person stands upright with fully locked-out hips and knees, maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core throughout the movement. The technique shown in the video is well-executed, demonstrating strength and control during the deadlift.
