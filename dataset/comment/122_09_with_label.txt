The cross drape red action in this video is good. The performer maintains a secure grip on the Liuxingchui, swings it to create a cross-shaped pattern, and executes both vertical and horizontal components smoothly. They transition between patterns with precision, keeping the rope taut and their movements controlled. Additionally, the 'Pi Hong' aspect adds continuity and artistry to the technique, enhancing the overall flow of the performance.
