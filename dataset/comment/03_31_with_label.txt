The barbell upright row action in this video is bad. The most critical flaw is the athlete's excessively narrow grip, which severely compromises shoulder health by forcing extreme internal rotation during the upward phase. Additionally, the athlete pulls the barbell far too high, well above the clavicles, further exacerbating the risk of shoulder impingement due to the highly abducted and internally rotated humerus. The initiation of the movement is also incorrect, starting from chest level rather than the standard position in front of the thighs. To correct this, the athlete must significantly widen their grip (at least shoulder-width), start the lift with the barbell resting against the thighs, and restrict the pull height so the bar stops around mid-chest level, ensuring the elbows remain higher than the wrists and point outwards to target the medial deltoids safely.
