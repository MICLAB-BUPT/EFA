The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character starts with a wide stance, but their feet are not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart. Their toes are pointing forward, which is correct, but the depth of the bend in their knees is not parallel to the ground. Additionally, the character's back is not straight, and their core is not engaged. These deviations from the ideal standards make the action suboptimal for practicing proper horse stance techniques. To improve, the character should maintain a wider stance with their toes pointing outward, deeply bend their knees to be parallel to the ground, keep their back straight, and engage their core.
