The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person starts by lying face up on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart, which sets the foundation for the exercise. They position the barbell across the hips, resting it in the hip crease, which ensures proper alignment and reduces the risk of injury. The individual places their hands on the barbell to stabilize it, maintaining a secure grip while keeping their arms relatively straight but not locked out. This helps in controlling the movement and preventing the bar from rolling.
