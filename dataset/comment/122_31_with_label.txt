The cross drape red action in this video is bad because the person starts with the hammer head already held in one hand, which is not ideal. The hammer should be swung to create a cross-shaped pattern, and starting with it held in one hand means the person cannot fully utilize the momentum of the swing. Additionally, the person's movements are not fluid or controlled, and the hammer does not trace a clear cross-shaped pattern. To improve, the person should start by swinging the hammer in a way that allows for a full range of motion and a smooth transition between vertical and horizontal swings.
