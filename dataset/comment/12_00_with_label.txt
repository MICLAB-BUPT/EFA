The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The person maintains a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise, which helps avoid locking out the arms and prevents unnecessary strain on the shoulders. They also keep their core engaged and maintain an upright posture with the chest up and shoulders back, minimizing the risk of slouching or leaning forward. The person lifts the dumbbells out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor (or slightly below), demonstrating control and initiating the movement from the shoulders. Additionally, they focus on lifting with the medial deltoids, leading with the elbows as if pouring water from a pitcher, ensuring proper engagement of the target muscle group. Lastly, the person lowers the dumbbells back to the starting position slowly, maintaining control and resisting the urge to drop them, which is crucial for muscle growth and strength development.
