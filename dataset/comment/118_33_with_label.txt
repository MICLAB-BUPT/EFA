The wrist flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, which affects the visual appeal of the 'flower' pattern created by the sword. The non-wielding hand is not coordinated with the blade movement, indicating a lack of balance and control. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable and balanced posture while practicing the wrist rotation to ensure the sword moves smoothly in circular or figure-eight patterns.
