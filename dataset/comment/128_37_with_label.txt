The staff lift action in this video is bad. The person starts with a balanced stance, but the grip on the staff is not closer to one end, which would provide better leverage for the upward lifting motion. Additionally, the person does not explosively extend their legs and hips upward, resulting in a lack of force and control in the movement. There is also a lack of smoothness and control in the upward motion of the staff, indicating poor technique. To improve, the person should ensure a proper grip on the staff, generate more force by extending their legs and hips, and maintain a smooth, controlled arc throughout the movement.
