The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The character starts in a stable stance, with the staff held firmly. He then prepares for the lifting action by positioning the staff low to the ground, demonstrating proper hand positioning. As he lifts the staff upwards, his body coils slightly, preparing to generate upward power. His wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff upwards and outwards, maintaining balance and control throughout the movement. The focus remains on executing the technique with precision and fluidity, ensuring that the power is generated from the legs and core. Overall, the character's actions align well with the ideal steps provided, resulting in a refined and effective performance.
