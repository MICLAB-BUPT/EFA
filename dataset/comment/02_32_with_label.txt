The barbell bent-over row action in this video is bad. The initial hip hinge lacks depth and stability, as the torso is only slightly inclined (above 45 degrees), which engages the lower back excessively instead of isolating the lats. To correct this, the individual must increase the hip hinge angle to bring the torso closer to parallel with the floor, allowing for maximum lat stretch and engagement while maintaining a neutral spine. The subsequent pulling phase is dominated by significant momentum, where the hips and knees extend rapidly, turning the movement into a partial clean rather than a strict row, severely reducing the exercise's effectiveness for back development. The individual must lower the weight significantly and eliminate body English, focusing on driving the elbows straight toward the ceiling and squeezing the scapulae together at the top of the movement. Furthermore, the wide grip and flared elbows seen throughout the rep shift the focus away from the lats and towards the upper traps and biceps. The grip should be narrowed to just outside shoulder-width, and the elbows should be kept close to the body to ensure optimal lat muscle recruitment.
