The incline barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The individual starts by holding the barbell above his head, which is not a standard starting position for an incline bench press. The ideal starting position would be with the barbell resting on the rack at chest level. Additionally, the person's grip appears to be too wide, which could lead to decreased stability and control during the exercise. To improve, the individual should start with the barbell at chest level, use a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and ensure proper form throughout the movement.
