The rope slide action in this video is bad because the person does not follow the ideal sequence of steps for practicing the 'Liu Sheng' technique. The individual starts by swinging the hammer head, which is not the recommended initial step as it should be held in one hand and allowed to slide through the other hand. Additionally, the person does not control the amount of rope being released properly, leading to a less precise and fluid motion. To improve, the person should practice holding the rope with a secure grip, allowing the hammer head to slide through the hand while maintaining control over the length and tension of the rope. This will result in smoother and more controlled movements, aligning with the ideal standards for practicing the 'Liu Sheng' technique.
