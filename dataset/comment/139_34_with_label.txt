The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character initiates the sweeping motion without a stable stance, leading to an unbalanced and less powerful execution. The body rotation and arm extension are not coordinated effectively, resulting in an awkward and inefficient movement. The blade angle is not consistent throughout the sweep, and the wrist is not firm enough, which affects the control of the sword's path. The stepping motion is not smooth or controlled, further compromising the stability and power of the technique. To improve, the character should focus on establishing a stable stance with proper weight distribution, initiate the sweep from the waist and hips with rotational force, maintain a consistent blade angle, and execute a controlled stepping motion that complements the movement while keeping balance.
