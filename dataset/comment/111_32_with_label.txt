The crushing staff action in this video is bad because the player's stance and grip on the staff are not stable or firm. The player appears to be holding the staff loosely, which can lead to poor control during the strike. Additionally, the movement lacks the necessary coiling and energy generation for a powerful burst, resulting in an ineffective strike. To improve, the player should work on establishing a stable and firm grip, practice proper coiling and energy transfer, and execute the 'Beng' with more force and precision.
