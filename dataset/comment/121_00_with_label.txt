The rope slide action in this video is good. The person maintains a secure grip on the rope, allowing it to slide through their hand with control and precision. They extend the rope smoothly before initiating the swing, ensuring a continuous motion. The person also adjusts the rope length during the continuous motion, demonstrating good technique. To further refine their technique, they could focus on increasing the speed and complexity of the movements while maintaining control over the hammer head throughout the action.
