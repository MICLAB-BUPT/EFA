The barbell front squat action in this video is bad. The person's form is not ideal, as they are not maintaining an upright torso and their elbows are not high enough. Additionally, the person is not driving through their heels to return to the starting position, which can lead to a lack of stability and control during the exercise. To improve, the person should focus on keeping their chest up, maintaining a tight core, and driving through their heels to ensure proper form and control throughout the movement.
