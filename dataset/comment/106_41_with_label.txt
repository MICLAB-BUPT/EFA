The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The character starts with an incorrect grip on the sword, which is not firm but rather relaxed. This can lead to a lack of control and stability during the movement. Additionally, the character's stance is not fully established before beginning the 'Chan Tou' motion, resulting in an incomplete preparation for the head-wrapping action. To improve, the character should ensure a firm grip on the sword, properly establish the 'Gong Bu' stance, and initiate the 'Chan Tou' motion with proper coordination and control.
