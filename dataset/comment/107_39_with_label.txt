The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a firm but relaxed grip on the sword, which is crucial for control and precision. Additionally, the character's posture and footwork are not optimal; they do not demonstrate the proper 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with correct knee bending and alignment. These deviations might result in a lack of power and precision during the thrust, making the technique ineffective and potentially unsafe. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a strong grip, proper footwork, and a stable base throughout the motion.
