The pull up action in this video is bad. While the band-assisted nature of the exercise is appropriate for the goal, the primary flaw is the significant range of motion deficit; the athlete fails to return to a complete dead hang with fully extended elbows on the eccentric phase. Stopping short compromises the activation of the lats and prevents full shoulder mobility. Additionally, there is a lack of sustained neutral head position, with the neck jutting forward to clear the bar. To improve, the athlete must ensure a controlled descent to full elbow extension for every repetition, pausing briefly in the dead hang to reset the shoulders. They should also maintain a neutral cervical spine by keeping the gaze fixed slightly forward, preventing unnecessary neck strain and reinforcing the overall body tension.
