The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a firm but relaxed grip on the Dao throughout the movement, which is a deviation from the ideal standards. Additionally, the character's wrist and forearm are not used effectively to control the Dao's momentum during the 'Chan Tou' motion. To improve, the character should ensure that they have a firm but relaxed grip on the Dao and use their wrist, forearm, and body rotation to control the movement effectively.
