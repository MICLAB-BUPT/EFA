The staff point action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, with a firm grip on the staff. The preparation for the 'Dian Gun' involves positioning the staff so that the tip is aimed towards the intended target. The execution of the 'Dian Gun' is quick and precise, using the tip of the staff to strike the target. The power is generated from the ground, through the legs and core, and transferred through the arms. The movement is short and sharp, like a jab. The body remains stable and balanced, supporting the thrust. The character maintains control and precision throughout the movement, avoiding overextension or telegraphing the strike.
