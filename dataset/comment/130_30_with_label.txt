The spear point action in this video is bad. The character starts with a balanced stance but then loses balance and falls backward, which indicates a lack of control over their movement. Additionally, the character does not execute the step or shift towards the target quickly enough, which could compromise accuracy. Lastly, the character extends the spear arm forward with a snapping motion, but it's unclear if they maintain focus on the target or if the force comes from speed and precision rather than a powerful thrust. To improve, the character should work on maintaining balance, executing quick and precise movements, and ensuring accurate contact with the target.
