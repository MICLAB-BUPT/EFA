The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person lies on their back with knees bent and feet flat, properly positioning the barbell across their hips. They maintain a secure grip on the bar, brace their core, and drive through their heels to lift their hips off the ground, forming a straight line from shoulders to knees. The person holds the bridge position briefly before lowering their hips back down with control. The movements are executed smoothly and with proper form, indicating effective technique.
