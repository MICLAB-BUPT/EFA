The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual starts by lying on their back with knees bent and feet flat on the ground, positioning the barbell across the hips as instructed. They also engage their core and stabilize the barbell with their hands. The person then drives through the heels to lift the hips off the floor, maintaining a straight line from shoulders to knees. Lastly, they hold the bridge position for a brief pause before lowering the hips back down with control. This sequence of movements demonstrates proper form and technique for performing a barbell glute bridge.
