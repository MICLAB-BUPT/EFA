The spinning whip action in this video is good. The person starts in a stable stance, holding the handle of the whip firmly with one hand and extending the chain, either resting on the ground or held loosely in the other hand, ready to be deployed. They initiate the turn of their body using their legs and core strength to generate momentum. As they turn, they begin swinging the whip, using their body's rotation to generate the initial force for the whip's movement. The person continues the turning motion while swinging the whip, controlling its trajectory. They complete the turn and strike, bringing the whip to a controlled stop or transitioning into another technique. The focus is on maintaining balance and control throughout the entire sequence, even with dynamic turning and whipping motions.
