The crushing staff action in this video is bad because the person does not start with a stable stance. The initial position of the person is not ideal for executing a proper strike, which can lead to a lack of power and control during the movement. Additionally, the person does not initiate the 'Beng Gun' with a coiled or loaded body, resulting in a less effective transfer of energy through the arms to the staff. These deviations from the ideal standards make the action less powerful and controlled.
