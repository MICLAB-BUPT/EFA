The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by positioning their feet hip-width apart, gripping the bar with an overhand or mixed grip, and maintaining a neutral spine throughout the movement. They also engage their core, brace their abdomen, and drive through their heels to initiate the lift. By keeping the bar close to the body and extending the legs and hips simultaneously, they maintain control and stability during the exercise. Finally, they lower the bar under control while reversing the motion, ensuring a full range of motion and proper technique.
