The knife flourish action in this video is bad. The character performs the motion with a relaxed grip, which may not be ideal for maintaining control and precision. The motion is not fluid or continuous, indicating that the execution lacks the finesse required for a proper 'Wu Dao Hua' technique. To improve, the character should focus on developing a more controlled and fluid wrist movement, as well as ensuring a balanced stance to enhance the visual impact of the technique.
