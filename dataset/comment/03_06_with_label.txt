The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper form by standing with their feet shoulder-width apart, holding the barbell with an overhand grip, and keeping their back straight and core engaged throughout the exercise. They initiate the lift by pulling the barbell straight up, keeping it close to their body, and continue pulling until the bar reaches chest level or slightly below. The elbows are also higher than the wrists, which helps avoid excessive stress on the shoulder joints. Finally, they lower the barbell back down to the starting position in a controlled manner, demonstrating good technique and control.
