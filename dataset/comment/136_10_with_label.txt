The sword thrust action in this video is good. The character begins with a balanced stance, holding the sword with a relaxed grip, and initiates the thrust smoothly by extending the arm forward while stepping forward. The body maintains alignment throughout the movement, ensuring power and accuracy. The completion of the thrust is marked by full extension of the arm and body, indicating control and balance. These aspects contribute to the overall effectiveness and precision of the sword thrust, making it a well-executed technique.
