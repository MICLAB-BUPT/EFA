The spear twist action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a firm grip on the spear and maintains a stable stance, preparing to engage with an opponent's weapon. The contact point with the opponent's weapon is closer to their hands, providing leverage for the twisting motion. The person uses a combination of wrist, arm, and body rotation to execute the twisting action smoothly and deliberately, applying constant pressure and control throughout the movement. The execution of the twist seems well-practiced and controlled, ensuring the opponent's weapon remains under control or is disarmed.
