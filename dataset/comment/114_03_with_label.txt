The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the staff firmly with a firm grip. The preparation for the 'Ti' (lifting) action is executed by positioning the staff low, near the ground or at waist level, and the body coils slightly to generate upward power. The lifting motion is combined with a forward movement, creating an upward and outward scooping or raising action. The wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff upwards and outwards, generating power from the legs and core. After the 'Ti Liao', the character can retract the staff to a guard position, maintaining balance and control throughout the movement.
