The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper grip, starting with the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. They also demonstrate good form during the descent, lowering the barbell to their chest with controlled movement and maintaining an appropriate elbow angle. During the ascent, they push the barbell back up to the starting position with a steady motion, avoiding any excessive lockout. Overall, the technique appears well-executed, emphasizing strength and control throughout the exercise.
