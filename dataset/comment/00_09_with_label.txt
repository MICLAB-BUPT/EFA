The pull up action in this video is good. the individual activates the appropriate posterior chain musculature (back and shoulders) for the concentric pull, elevating the chin above the horizontal bar,Initiating from a passive dead hang with full arm extension and shoulder relaxation. Head alignment is maintained throughout the ascent and during the controlled eccentric phase, returning to the full extension hang. This execution exemplifies fundamental biomechanical principles for an effective and safe pull-up.
