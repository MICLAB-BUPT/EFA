The sword chop action in this video is bad. The person in the video starts with a forward thrust of the sword, which is not ideal as it lacks the necessary power and control required for a proper sword chop. Additionally, the person's grip on the sword is not firm enough, which can lead to instability during the movement. To improve, the person should start with a stable stance and a relaxed grip, then raise the sword above their head or shoulder to prepare for the downward chopping motion. The wrist and forearm should be used to control the blade's angle and ensure a clean cut. The non-wielding hand should move for balance or to assist in generating power. Finally, the person should execute the 'Pi' with sufficient force and precision, bringing the sword to a lower position near the waist or thigh, depending on the style and intended application.
