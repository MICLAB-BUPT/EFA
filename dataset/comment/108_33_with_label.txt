The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and coordinated, which can lead to a lack of power and control in the technique. Additionally, the character's form appears to be incomplete, with the 'Pu Bu' (drop step) and 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action) not being executed properly. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper body posture, ensuring that the 'Pu Bu' is stable and controlled, and performing the 'Dai Dao' with fluidity and precision. This will help to generate more power and accuracy in the technique, making it more effective and visually appealing.
