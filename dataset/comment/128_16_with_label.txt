The staff lift action in this video is good. The person starts with a balanced stance, ensuring a stable base for the lift. They also slightly lower their body by bending the knees, which prepares them to generate upward force. The arms begin to lift the staff, guiding its upward trajectory smoothly and with control. Throughout the movement, the person maintains balance and control, preventing any loss of momentum or stability. These aspects align with the ideal standards for a proper staff lift, making it an effective technique.
