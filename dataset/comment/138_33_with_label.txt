The tai chi sword stir action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a centered and balanced posture, which is essential for proper form. Additionally, the upward movement (Liao) from the wrist and forearm is executed incorrectly; it appears to be a simple upward thrust rather than a controlled lift with the wrist rotating in the direction of the movement. This lack of fluidity and precision reduces the effectiveness of the technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, using the wrist to control the angle and precision of the movement, and coordinating the upward arc with a subtle shift in body weight and waist rotation.
