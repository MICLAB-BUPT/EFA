The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual has a proper setup on the decline bench, with feet secured and the eyes positioned correctly below the barbell when racked. The grip is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, which is appropriate for a decline bench press. The unracking of the barbell is done with arms extended and wrists straight, maintaining a safe and efficient movement. The individual lowers the barbell under control to the lower chest area while keeping elbows tucked in and maintaining a 45-degree angle to the body. Finally, the push back up to the starting position is executed with a slight bend in the elbows at the top, ensuring that the core and glutes are engaged throughout the movement.
