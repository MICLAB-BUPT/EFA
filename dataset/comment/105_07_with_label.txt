The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The character maintains a solid "Ma Bu" (horse stance) with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, knees deeply bent, and the back straight. The hands are positioned in a guard position or chambered at the waist, ready for the downward chopping strikes. The execution of the "Shuang Pi Quan" (double chopping fists) involves a powerful downward motion with both fists simultaneously, generating power from the core and the downward movement of the arms. The elbows are slightly bent at the point of impact, and the fists are angled slightly downwards. After the strikes, the character retracts the fists back to a guard position or chambered position, maintaining the "Ma Bu" throughout the entire movement. These aspects demonstrate stability and power, making the action effective and well-executed.
