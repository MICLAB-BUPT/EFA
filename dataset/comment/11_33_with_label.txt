The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The character begins by holding the barbell with an underhand grip, but the elbows are not close to the torso and the upper arms are moving instead of originating from the elbow joint. Additionally, the character does not engage the core or maintain control during the lowering phase, which can lead to poor form and increased risk of injury. To improve, the character should focus on keeping the elbows close to the torso, engaging the core, and controlling the movement throughout the exercise.
