The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine, keeps the chest up, and uses their heels to drive through during the ascent. The stance width is appropriate for stability and depth, and the person demonstrates proper form throughout the exercise. These aspects indicate that the technique is well-executed and likely effective for building strength and muscle endurance.
