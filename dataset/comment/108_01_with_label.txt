The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is good. The character begins from a preparatory stance and transitions smoothly into the drop step or flat step, maintaining a secure grip on the Dao (broadsword). The execution of the 'Pu Bu' is precise, with the body bending and shifting weight effectively to maintain balance. Simultaneously, the 'Dai Dao' motion is fluid and coordinated with the drop step, showcasing the character's control over the blade. The movement is executed with core strength and momentum, providing a stable and powerful finish. Overall, the performance demonstrates good technique and precision in executing the pounce step carrying knife form.
