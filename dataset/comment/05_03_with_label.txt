The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual lies on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat, positioning the barbell across the hips. They maintain a secure grip on the barbell and brace their core for stability. By driving through the heels and squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the ground, they form a straight line from shoulders to knees while avoiding excessive lower back hyperextension. Holding the bridge position at the top and slowly lowering the hips back down demonstrates control and proper technique.
