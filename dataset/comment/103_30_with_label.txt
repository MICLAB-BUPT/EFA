The horse stance punch action in this video is bad. The character does not properly establish a solid 'Ma Bu' (horse stance) with their feet positioned significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. Their knees are not deeply bent, and the back is not straight with the core engaged. The hand positioning is also suboptimal, with one hand chambered at the waist but not in a guard position or also chambered at the waist. Additionally, the character's punch is not initiated from the ground through the legs and core, and there is no rotation of the waist during the punch. The punch is not extended forward aiming for chest or face level, and the focus is not on maintaining the 'Ma Bu' throughout the punch, resulting in instability and imbalance.
