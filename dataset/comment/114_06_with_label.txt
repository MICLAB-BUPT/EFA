The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The man maintains a stable stance while holding the staff with a firm grip, preparing for the 'Ti' (lifting) action. He initiates the movement by lifting the staff upwards, demonstrating proper technique. The wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff outwards, generating upward power from the legs and core. The focus on balance and control throughout the motion is evident.
