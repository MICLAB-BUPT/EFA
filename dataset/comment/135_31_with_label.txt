The downward staff chop action in this video is bad. The person does not start with a firm grip on the nunchaku, holding it either overhead or at shoulder level, prepared for a downward strike. Instead, they start with a mask on their face and then swing the nunchaku downwards without proper form. This lack of preparation and incorrect grip can lead to a less effective strike and potential injury. To improve, the person should practice starting with a proper grip and stance, ensuring that they have a stable and balanced position before initiating the downward strike.
