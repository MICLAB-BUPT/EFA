The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The person starts by lying face up on a flat bench with feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. They then extend their arms straight up above the chest, keeping a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. The upper arms are kept stationary throughout the exercise, and the only movement occurs at the elbow joint. The person takes a breath and braces the core, maintaining a stable torso on the bench. They slowly lower the dumbbells towards the forehead while bending the elbows, maintaining control and keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the floor. Finally, they extend their arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement.
