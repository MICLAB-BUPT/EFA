The sweeping staff action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, providing a solid base for the sweeping motion. They grip the staff firmly and position it horizontally, ready to be swung across the body. The body coils slightly, storing potential energy, and then initiates the sweeping motion with fluid and continuous movement. The stance remains stable throughout the technique, demonstrating balance and control. The finishing position is well-executed, indicating that the character has a strong grasp of the ideal form and execution for the sweeping staff.
