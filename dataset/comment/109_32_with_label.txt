The knife flourish action in this video is bad. The character demonstrates poor control and stability, which is evident from the lack of fluidity and precision in the motions. The movements appear rushed and disconnected, lacking the controlled, circular, or figure-eight patterns characteristic of proper knife flourishes. To improve, the character should focus on developing a strong grip, maintaining a neutral stance, and practicing controlled, deliberate motions to create clear visual patterns with the blade.
