The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is bad. The character begins in a stable stance but then starts to move the staff in an awkward manner, which is not aligned with proper techniques. This lack of control and form may result in improper execution of the technique, potentially leading to injuries or inefficiencies in movement. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a steady and controlled grip on the staff, positioning it correctly at the beginning, and executing the lifting and flicking actions smoothly and with precision.
