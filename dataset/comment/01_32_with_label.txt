The barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The most critical error is the unsafe bar path and landing position, where the athlete lowers the barbell too high, aiming toward the neck or upper chest rather than the mid-to-lower sternum. This poor trajectory compromises shoulder stability and strains the anterior shoulder joint. Additionally, the athlete exhibits poor scapular retraction; the shoulders are not adequately pinned back and down, which further destabilizes the shoulder girdle. To correct this, the athlete must first execute a proper setup by actively retracting and depressing the scapulae. Second, the bar path must be steepened to ensure the bar touches the mid-to-lower chest (nipple line) before being pressed back up and slightly backward over the shoulders at the top.
