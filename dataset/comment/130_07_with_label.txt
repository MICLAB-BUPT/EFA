The spear point action in this video is good. The individual maintains a balanced and agile stance, which allows for quick and accurate movements. The grip on the spear is appropriate, ensuring better control and flexibility. The step towards the target is small and fast, emphasizing speed and precision over power. The spear arm is extended with a quick snapping motion, primarily using the wrist and forearm, which aligns with the ideal technique of making contact with the very tip of the spear. Finally, the retraction after contact is immediate, returning to a ready position, showcasing proper defense and preparation for subsequent attacks or movements.
