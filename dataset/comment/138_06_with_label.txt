The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The character maintains a balanced posture and performs the upward movement with a smooth, arcing path, using the wrist to control the angle and precision of the movement. The blade's edge faces the direction of the arc, demonstrating a controlled lift rather than a slash. The waist rotation adds power and fluidity to the technique, ensuring the character does not lean excessively or lose balance during the motion. The final position allows for the transition into another technique or return to a guard position, showcasing the flexibility of the wrist and readiness for further movements.
