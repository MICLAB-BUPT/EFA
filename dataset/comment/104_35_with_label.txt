The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a solid 'Ma Bu' (horse stance) with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. The knees are not deeply bent, and the thighs are not parallel to the ground. The back is not straight, and the core is not engaged. Additionally, the specific initial hand positioning and the trajectory of the 'Lou Shou' are not clearly demonstrated. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper form and technique, ensuring that the 'Ma Bu' is stable and powerful, and that the hand movements are fluid and controlled.
