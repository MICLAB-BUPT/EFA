The sword stir action in this video is good. The practitioner maintains a stable stance and demonstrates control over the sword, initiating the upward cut with precision. The execution of the 'Liao' (upward cutting or raising) action shows a smooth transition from the initial position to the higher level, indicating proper technique and form. The practitioner's grip on the sword is firm yet relaxed, allowing for fluid movement. While the finishing position is not fully visible, the sequence appears to be well-executed and in line with the ideal steps provided.
