The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form and technique throughout the exercise, including lying on a decline bench with feet secured, gripping the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, unracking the barbell with arms extended, lowering the barbell under control to the lower chest, pushing it back up to the starting position, and maintaining core engagement. The execution appears controlled and efficient, indicating a well-executed exercise.
