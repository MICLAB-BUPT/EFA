The crushing staff action in this video is bad. The character's form does not align with the ideal standards of a proper technique. In the first frame, the person is holding the staff horizontally, which is not an ideal starting position for a 'Beng Gun' strike. The stance appears to be stable but lacks the balance and control necessary for effective execution. Additionally, there is no clear indication of the power being generated from the ground or the coiling motion required for the burst of energy. To improve, the person should start with a horse or bow stance, generate power from the legs and core, and initiate the strike with a strong upward motion.
