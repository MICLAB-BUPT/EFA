The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance, holding the sword with a firm grip and transitioning into a 'Gong Bu' (bow stance). They step forward with one leg while simultaneously initiating the 'Zha Dao' (thrusting action) with the sword. The thrust is executed with power and precision, maintaining balance and control throughout the movement. This sequence of actions demonstrates a strong foundation and proper technique for the bow stance thrusting knife form.
