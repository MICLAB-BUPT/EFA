The barbell deadlift action in this video is bad. The character's form deviates from the ideal standards, resulting in potential injury risks and reduced effectiveness of the exercise. The first issue is the positioning of the feet; they are not hip-width apart but instead spread wider than necessary. This can lead to a less stable base and an increased risk of knee strain or instability. The second issue is the grip on the barbell; the hands are too wide apart, which could result in excessive stress on the wrists and lower back. Lastly, the character's posture is slightly hunched over, with a lack of emphasis on keeping the spine neutral. This can contribute to poor spinal alignment and increase the risk of back injuries. To improve the form, the character should adjust their foot placement to be hip-width apart, grip the bar closer to their body, and ensure proper back alignment while lifting.
