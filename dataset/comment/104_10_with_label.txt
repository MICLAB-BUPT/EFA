The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The person demonstrates a solid and wide stance with their feet significantly apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward, knees deeply bent, and the back straight. They maintain core engagement throughout the movement, which provides stability and power. The hand positioning is also correct, with one hand performing the 'Lou Shou' (scooping/raking hand) motion starting from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards. The arm movement is controlled and fluid, and the person uses the power generated from the 'Ma Bu' to execute the technique effectively.
