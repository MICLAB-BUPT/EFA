The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual is seen lying on a decline bench with their feet secured under the pads, and their eyes positioned slightly below the barbell when it's racked. They have a grip that is wider than shoulder-width apart, which is appropriate for a decline bench press. Their unracking technique is also good, as they keep their wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked while taking a deep breath and bracing the core. The descent of the barbell to the lower chest is controlled, maintaining a roughly 45-degree angle to the body. Lastly, the upward push back to the starting position is performed with a slight bend in the elbows, ensuring the core and glutes are engaged throughout the movement. Overall, the individual demonstrates proper form and technique for a decline barbell bench press.
