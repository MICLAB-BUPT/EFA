The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper stance with feet shoulder-width apart and a firm grip on the barbell. The elbows remain close to the body, and the wrists are straight throughout the exercise. Additionally, the person engages their core muscles for stability and control during the curl. These actions demonstrate a strong foundation for performing the standing barbell curl effectively and safely.
