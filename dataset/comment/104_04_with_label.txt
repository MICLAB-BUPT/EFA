The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a solid 'Ma Bu' with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, knees deeply bent, and back straight. The hands are positioned in a way that allows for a sweeping motion, starting from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards, or from a lower position moving outwards and upwards. The arm movements are controlled and fluid, with the power generated from the 'Ma Bu' and the rotation of the waist. Additionally, the character maintains stability and power throughout the movement, ensuring a strong foundation for the technique.
