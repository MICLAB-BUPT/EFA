The spinning whip action in this video is good. The person starts in a stable stance, holding the handle of the whip firmly and ready to be deployed. They initiate the turning motion of the body, using their legs and core strength to generate momentum. As they turn, they begin to swing the whip, which is an essential part of the technique. The person continues the turning motion and the swing, maintaining control over the whip's trajectory. Finally, they complete the turn and strike, bringing the whip to a controlled stop or transitioning into another technique. The focus remains on balance and control throughout the entire sequence, showcasing the dynamic turning and whipping motions.
