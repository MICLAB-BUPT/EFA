The spear flourish action in this video is good. The person begins with a relaxed but firm grip on the spear, holding it near the center or slightly towards the rear. They initiate the 'flower' movements using their wrists, arms, and body to create circular or figure-eight patterns with the spear, which are fluid and continuous. Throughout the movements, they maintain control of the spear, keeping it close to their body and avoiding uncontrolled swings. The person also incorporates body movement, such as stepping, turning, and shifting weight, to enhance the flow and dynamism of the dance. Additionally, they practice transitioning smoothly between different 'flower' patterns and incorporating other spear techniques, making the performance more complex and versatile.
