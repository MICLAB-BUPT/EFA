The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The character's elbows are not close to the torso and are moving excessively, which is a deviation from the ideal standards of keeping the elbows stationary throughout the movement. This excessive movement can lead to poor form and potential injury. To improve, the character should focus on keeping their elbows close to their body and engaging their core muscles for stability.
