The wrist flourish action in this video is good. The practitioner maintains a firm but relaxed grip on the sword and performs a fluid, continuous movement with the blade creating a visually appealing pattern. The wrist rotation is controlled, and the technique appears to be executed with precision and balance. To further refine the technique, the practitioner can focus on increasing speed and complexity while maintaining control of the blade.
