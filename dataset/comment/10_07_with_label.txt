The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual has a proper grip on the barbell, with their hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and the thumb wrapped around it. They maintain a controlled descent, keeping their elbows tucked in and the barbell close to their body. The upward push is also smooth and controlled, with the individual exhaling forcefully. Overall, the form appears stable and efficient, minimizing unnecessary strain on the shoulders.
