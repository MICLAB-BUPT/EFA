The horse stance punch action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a solid 'Ma Bu' (horse stance) with feet positioned wider than shoulder-width apart and knees deeply bent. The hand positioning, starting from the waist and transitioning into a chambered fist, is also well-executed. The thrusting punch is initiated with proper core engagement and leg drive, ensuring stability throughout the movement. While the punching arm is extended forward, aiming at chest level, the focus remains on maintaining the 'Ma Bu' stance. The sequence of retracting the fist back to the chambered position after delivering the punch further showcases good technique. Overall, the character's form and execution of the horse stance punch are commendable, demonstrating a strong foundation in martial arts practice.
