The staff throw action in this video is good. The character begins with a firm grip on the staff, initiating the throw by rotating the hips and torso, extending the arms outward as the core rotation continues, and releasing the staff at the precise moment when the force vector is directed towards the intended target. This sequence demonstrates the ideal technique for generating power and accuracy in the throw.
