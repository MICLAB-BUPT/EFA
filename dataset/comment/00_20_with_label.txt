The pull up action in this video is good. The person starts with a dead hang, grips the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and initiates the pull by engaging their back and shoulder muscles. They continue pulling until their chin is above the bar, demonstrating good form and control throughout the movement.
