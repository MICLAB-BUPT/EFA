The staff throw action in this video is bad. The character's grip on the staff is not firm enough, and the stance is not stable with feet shoulder-width apart. This lack of proper grip and stance will result in a loss of power and control during the throw. Additionally, the character does not initiate the throw by rotating the hips and torso as intended. Instead, they simply use arm strength, which is not an ideal technique for generating momentum. Furthermore, the character's arms are not acting as levers to guide and amplify the force; instead, they appear to be the primary source of power. Finally, the release of the staff occurs at an inappropriate moment, which will also affect the accuracy and power of the throw. To improve, the character should focus on developing a strong grip, maintaining a stable stance, and utilizing core rotation to generate power.
