The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back and neutral head position, which helps prevent injury and ensures proper form. They also keep their elbows close to their body during the lift, which targets the intended muscle group effectively. Additionally, the person maintains control throughout the descent, avoiding any momentum or rounding of the back. These aspects contribute to a well-executed and safe exercise routine.
