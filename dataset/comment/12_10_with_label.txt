The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The woman stands with her feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing the body, and maintains a slight bend in her elbows throughout the exercise. Her core is engaged, and she keeps an upright posture with her chest up and shoulders back, avoiding slouching or leaning forward. She takes a breath and raises her arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor (or slightly below), focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. The movement is controlled, initiated from the shoulders, and led with the elbows, as if pouring water from a pitcher. Finally, she slowly lowers the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control and resisting the urge to drop them. The lowering phase is crucial for muscle growth and strength development.
