The staff point action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a stable stance and firm grip on the staff, preparing for the 'Dian Gun' (pointing staff) technique. The movements are quick, precise, and controlled, with the power generated from the ground through the legs and core, transferred to the arms. The body remains stable and balanced throughout the action, ensuring a sharp and short thrust towards the target. The character maintains control and precision, avoiding overextension or telegraphing the strike. Overall, the performance showcases a well-executed and refined staff point technique.
