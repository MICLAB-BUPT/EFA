The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The man starts with a proper grip, lying on the bench at an appropriate angle. He unracks the barbell smoothly and brings it down to his chest, maintaining control throughout the movement. His elbows are tucked in at a good angle, and he pushes the barbell back up to the starting position with good form. This demonstrates a well-executed incline barbell bench press technique.
