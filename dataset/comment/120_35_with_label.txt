The elbow whip action in this video is bad because the person's movements are not fluid and controlled. They appear to be swinging the whip with a jerky motion, which can lead to loss of precision and control. Additionally, the person's stance is not stable, which further compromises their ability to execute the technique effectively. To improve, they should focus on maintaining a steady stance, using smooth and controlled movements, and practicing proper whip handling techniques to achieve better precision and power in their strikes.
