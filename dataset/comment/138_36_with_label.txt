The tai chi sword stir action in this video is bad because the person starts with an incorrect stance, as they are not in a balanced or centered position. The body is not upright and relaxed, which affects the execution of the movement. Additionally, the person's weight distribution is not optimal, leading to an unsteady stance. The upward movement (Liao) is also executed incorrectly; the wrist is not used properly, and the blade's edge is not facing the direction of the arc. These deviations from proper technique result in a less effective and controlled sword stir. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a stable and balanced posture, using the wrist correctly for the Liao movement, and ensuring the blade's edge is oriented appropriately.
