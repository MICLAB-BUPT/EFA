The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper stance with feet shoulder-width apart and hands slightly wider than hip-width, ensuring balance and reducing lower back stress. They keep their elbows close to the torso and maintain control throughout the movement, demonstrating good form. The focus on squeezing the biceps at the top of the curl and controlling the lowering phase also contribute to the overall effectiveness of the exercise.
