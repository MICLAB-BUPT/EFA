The spear point action in this video is bad. The person does not maintain a balanced and agile stance, which makes it difficult to move quickly and accurately. Additionally, the grip on the spear is not ideal, as it may be too loose or too tight, affecting control of the spear tip. Furthermore, the movement towards the target is not quick enough, and the snap motion is not precise enough, resulting in an inaccurate 'point'. Lastly, the retraction after making contact with the target is not immediate, which could compromise defense and preparation for subsequent attacks.
