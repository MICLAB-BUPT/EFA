The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back, engaged core, and chest up throughout the exercise. They start with the barbell resting in front of their thighs, with hands closer than shoulder-width apart. The elbows lead the movement as they pull the barbell upwards, keeping it close to their body. The barbell reaches chest level or slightly below, with elbows higher than wrists. The person then lowers the barbell back down slowly, maintaining control throughout the descent. The stance is stable with feet shoulder-width apart, and there's a slight bend in the knees.
