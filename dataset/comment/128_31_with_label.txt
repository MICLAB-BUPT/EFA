The staff lift action in this video is bad. The person starts with a balanced stance, but the grip on the staff is not ideal as it is closer to one end, which can affect the upward lifting motion. The body is not lowered slightly before extending the legs and hips upward, which means that potential energy is not being stored for an explosive movement. The arms are also not beginning to lift the staff simultaneously, which could lead to a less coordinated motion. Lastly, the person does not maintain balance and control throughout the entire movement, resulting in a loss of momentum and stability. To improve, the person should start with a proper grip, lower their body, generate upward force, and coordinate the arms and legs for a smooth arc.
