The staff lift action in this video is good. The individual starts with a balanced stance, feet shoulder-width apart, which provides a stable base for the lift. They slightly lower their body by bending the knees to generate upward force, and then explosively extend their legs and hips to drive the staff upwards. The arms are used to control the direction and angle of the staff's upward trajectory, maintaining balance and control throughout the movement. The staff moves in a smooth arc, reaching its peak height before transitioning into the next technique or movement. This sequence demonstrates good form and technique for a staff lift.
