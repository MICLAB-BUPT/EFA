The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper stance with feet hip-width apart, keeping the barbell over mid-foot and the shins almost touching it but slightly straighter than a conventional deadlift setup. The hips are hinged back while maintaining a slight bend in the knees, ensuring the back remains straight and neutral to avoid any rounding of the spine. The grip on the bar is either overhand or mixed, slightly wider than shoulder-width, and the individual takes a deep breath, bracing the core and engaging the abdominal muscles and lats.
