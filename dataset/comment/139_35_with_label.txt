The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character initiates the sweeping motion with an unstable stance, leading to a lack of control and power. The body rotation and arm extension are not properly coordinated, resulting in an awkward movement. The blade angle is inconsistent, and the stepping motion is not smooth or controlled. These deviations classify the action as 'bad' because they compromise the stability, balance, and effectiveness of the technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, coordinating body rotation with arm extension, and keeping the blade at a consistent angle. Additionally, the stepping motion should be smooth and controlled to enhance reach and power.
