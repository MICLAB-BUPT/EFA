The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The woman lies on the floor with her knees bent and feet flat, placing the barbell across her hips, which is a proper setup for the exercise. She also takes a deep breath and braces her core before driving through her heels to lift her hips off the ground, demonstrating control and stability. The pause at the top of the movement shows that she maintains glute engagement throughout the exercise. Lastly, she lowers her hips back down to the floor with control, avoiding any sudden movements or touching the ground forcefully.
