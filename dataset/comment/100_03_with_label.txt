The cloud hands action in this video is good. The person maintains a neutral stance with knees slightly bent and body centered throughout the sequence. The weight shift from one leg to the other is gradual and continuous, following the ideal steps of Tai Chi practice. The hands move in a coordinated, circular motion, maintaining connection and flow without crossing directly. The eyes follow the upper hand, demonstrating focus and awareness. The person repeats the 'Yun Shou' movement multiple times, as specified in the form. Overall, the performance is smooth, controlled, and demonstrates the principles of Tai Chi with precision and fluidity.
