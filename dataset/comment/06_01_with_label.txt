The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine and slightly straighter legs, as opposed to conventional deadlifts. They also hinge at the hips while keeping their back straight and engaging the abdominal muscles, which are key aspects of proper form. The bar is kept close to the legs throughout the lift, minimizing unnecessary strain on the lower back. The individual demonstrates a controlled descent and ascent, ensuring proper tension in the hamstrings and glutes. Overall, the technique shown is well-executed and adheres to the principles of effective barbell stiff-leg deadlifts.
