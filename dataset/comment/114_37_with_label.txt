The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is bad. The character does not start in a stable stance, which is essential for maintaining balance and control during the technique. Additionally, the lifting motion appears to be incomplete, as the staff is not fully extended upwards or outwards, indicating insufficient power generation from the legs and core. These deviations suggest that the action might lack proper form and technique, leading to potential inefficiency and increased risk of injury. To improve, the character should focus on starting in a stable stance with a firm grip on the staff, generating power from the legs and core, and executing the lifting motion with full extension and control.
