The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a balanced stance or a proper grip on the sword, which can lead to reduced control and power during the thrust. Additionally, the arm extension is not smooth and controlled, originating from the core, and there is no clear indication of a step forward with the front leg. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper form by starting in a balanced stance, initiating the thrust with a smooth and controlled extension from the core, and coordinating the arm movement with a step forward for increased power and reach.
