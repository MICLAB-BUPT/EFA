The spear twist action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not smooth and controlled, which can compromise the effectiveness of the technique. The twisting motion appears to be abrupt and lacks fluidity, which might make it difficult to maintain control over the weapon. Additionally, the grip on the spear is not firm enough, leading to less stability during the maneuver. To improve, the character should work on refining their grip and incorporating more fluid, continuous motions into their technique.
