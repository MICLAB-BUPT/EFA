The nunchaku flourish action in this video is good. The person demonstrates a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the nunchaku, allowing for free movement of the arms and body. They initiate the 'flower' movements by using wrist, arm, and shoulder rotations to swing the free handle in circular patterns. The person practices transitioning the swinging handle between different planes of motion, creating a flowing motion. Additionally, they incorporate body movement, such as stepping and shifting weight, to enhance the flow and dynamism of the performance. The nunchaku is continuously caught and transitioned into different grips and patterns, maintaining a unified and dynamic performance throughout the video.
