The staff parry action in this video is bad because the person's movements are not fluid or controlled. The body is not aligned correctly, and there is a lack of precision in the technique. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining proper form, including a stable stance, correct grip, and a sharp, controlled movement when performing the 'Bo Gun'. Additionally, they should practice transitioning smoothly between techniques to enhance their overall control and effectiveness.
