The nunchaku flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, as the free handle is not swung in a circular or figure-eight pattern. Instead, the free handle is held loosely and not utilized effectively. Additionally, there is no clear indication of the character practicing transitions between different planes of motion or incorporating body movement to enhance the flow and dynamism of the performance. To improve, the character should focus on creating a continuous and flowing motion with the free handle and utilize their body movements more effectively to complement the nunchaku actions.
