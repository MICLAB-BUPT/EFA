The pull up action in this video is bad. The primary issue with this pull-up is the excessive use of momentum, or kipping, which compromises the strictness and effectiveness of the exercise. Although the athlete starts from a dead hang, the rapid and uncontrolled acceleration during the ascent, coupled with a noticeable forward body swing, indicates that kinetic energy is being used to assist the lift rather than pure muscle strength. This reduces the time under tension for the back muscles. To improve, the athlete must focus on eliminating all body swing by maintaining a rigid hollow body position (squeezing the core and glutes) throughout the entire repetition. The pull should be initiated with deliberate scapular retraction before the elbows bend, ensuring a slow, controlled, and vertical ascent and descent.
