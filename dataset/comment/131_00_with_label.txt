The spear twist action in this video is good. The player begins in a stable stance, with firm but adaptable grip on the spear, allowing for both control and the necessary twisting motion. The contact point with the opponent's weapon is closer to the player's hands than to the spearhead, providing leverage. The player uses a combination of wrist, arm, and body rotation to execute the twisting motion smoothly and deliberately, maintaining constant pressure and control throughout. The technique is completed without any sudden jerks that could compromise balance or control. Overall, the player demonstrates a well-executed spear twist, with attention to proper form and technique.
