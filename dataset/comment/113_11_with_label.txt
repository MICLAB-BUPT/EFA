The sweeping staff action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance and holds the staff with a firm grip, demonstrating proper technique for executing the sweeping motion. The body's coiled position effectively stores potential energy, allowing for a powerful and fluid sweep across the body. The arms guide the staff, maintaining control throughout the movement. Although the finishing position isn't visible, the character's form appears consistent with ideal standards for sweeping staff techniques.
