The horse stance punch action in this video is bad. The character's form does not adhere to the ideal standards for a proper horse stance punch. They start with their legs apart and one leg raised, which is not a stable position for executing a punch. The stance is also not wide enough, as it should be significantly wider than shoulder-width apart. Furthermore, the hands are positioned incorrectly; one hand is not chambered at the waist while the other is not in a guard position or chambered at the waist either. These deviations make the action less effective and potentially more unstable. To improve, the character should start with a stable 'Ma Bu' stance, ensure their feet are wide apart, and position their hands correctly before delivering the punch.
