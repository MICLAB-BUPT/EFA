The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine and keeps the chest up throughout the movement, which helps to prevent injury and maintain proper form. The person also drives through the heels during the ascent, ensuring a stable and controlled return to the starting position. However, there is room for improvement in terms of depth and consistency in the squat. The individual could descend further to engage more of the glutes and hamstrings, while maintaining a stable core to ensure better muscle engagement. Additionally, they could work on keeping their back angle consistent throughout the squat to maximize the effectiveness of the exercise.
