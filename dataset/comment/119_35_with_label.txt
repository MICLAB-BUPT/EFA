The spinning whip action in this video is bad because the person starts with the whip chain extended, which is not ideal as per the ideal action steps. The ideal starting position should have the whip chain either resting on the ground or held loosely in the other hand, ready to be deployed. Additionally, the person's stance and body movement are not optimal for generating momentum, which is crucial for a successful whip swing. To improve, the person should start with the whip chain either on the ground or held loosely, then initiate the turn of the body (180 degrees or more) using their legs and core strength. They should also focus on maintaining balance and control throughout the entire sequence while swinging the whip.
