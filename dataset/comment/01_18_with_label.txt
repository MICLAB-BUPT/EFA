The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person maintains a proper grip with their hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, ensuring a consistent grip width throughout the exercise. Their elbows are at a 45-75 degree angle to their body, not flared out completely to the sides nor tucked completely into the sides. They also maintain control during the descent, lowering the barbell directly over their chest and pushing it back up to the starting position with a controlled and steady motion. These actions indicate a well-executed barbell bench press, demonstrating good form and technique.
