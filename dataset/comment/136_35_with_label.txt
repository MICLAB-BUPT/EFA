The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character's arm extension is not smooth and controlled, and the step forward with the front leg is not coordinated with the arm extension, leading to an unaligned movement. The tip of the sword is not the point of contact, which results in a lack of power and accuracy. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a straight line from the back heel through the hips and shoulders to the tip of the sword, and ensure that the step forward is coordinated with the arm extension for a more unified and powerful thrust.
