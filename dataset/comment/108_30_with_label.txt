The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad because the character does not maintain a secure and controlled grip on the Dao, as it is not mentioned to be held in one hand. The execution of the 'Pu Bu' (drop step or flat step) is also not fully demonstrated, as the video only shows the character lowering their body by bending both knees, shifting weight onto one leg while extending the other leg to the side with the foot flat on the ground. However, there is no clear indication of the torso remaining relatively upright. The 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action with the Dao) is also not fully shown, as the sweeping or drawing motion of the blade across the body is not clearly depicted. Additionally, the character's movements are not fluid and coordinated with the 'Pu Bu', and the body's core strength and the shifting of weight to generate power are not effectively demonstrated. To improve, the character should ensure they maintain a secure grip on the Dao, execute the 'Pu Bu' properly, and perform the 'Dai Dao' with fluidity and coordination.
