The spear point action in this video is bad. The woman starts with a balanced stance, but her movements are not as controlled or precise as they could be. Her step towards the target is smaller and faster, but it lacks the power and accuracy needed for an effective spear point. She extends her arm forward with a quick snapping motion, but the force comes from the speed rather than the wrist and forearm. Additionally, her retraction after making contact is quick, but she does not immediately return to a ready position. To improve, she should focus on maintaining balance, using proper body weight shifting, and applying more force through her wrist and forearm for a more powerful and accurate strike.
