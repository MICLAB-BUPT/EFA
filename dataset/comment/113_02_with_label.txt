The sweeping staff action in this video is good. The character begins with a stable stance, which provides a solid base for the sweeping motion. They hold the staff firmly and prepare for the 'Sao' (sweep) action by positioning it horizontally or diagonally across their body. The movement is fluid and continuous as they execute the sweep, using the power generated from the ground through the legs, core, and rotation of the waist. The arms guide the staff, maintaining control of the arc during the movement. The stance remains stable throughout the action, providing balance and control.
