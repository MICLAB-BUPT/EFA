The staff chop action in this video is good. The person begins in a stable stance, which provides a solid foundation for the powerful downward strike. The grip on the Nangun (Southern Staff) is firm, allowing for better control and leverage during the movement. The body coils slightly, storing potential energy for the downward strike. The execution of the 'Pi Gun' is precise, with the Nangun being driven downwards with force and balance. The transition to the next movement is smooth, showcasing the skill and technique involved in the staff chop. Overall, the action demonstrates good form and control throughout the sequence.
