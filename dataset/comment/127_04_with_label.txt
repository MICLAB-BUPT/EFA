The staff throw action in this video is good. The character begins with a firm grip on the staff, initiating the throw by rotating the hips and torso, and extends their arms outward to transfer power to the staff. The release of the staff at the precise moment towards the ground demonstrates accurate timing and coordination. Following through with the motion after releasing the staff helps maintain balance and prepares the character for the next movement or technique.
