The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad because the character's movements are not fluid and coordinated. The execution of the 'Dai Dao' motion appears rushed and lacks proper control, which may result in poor form and potential safety hazards. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a steady pace while drawing the knife, ensuring that the body's core strength is utilized to generate power. Additionally, the character should ensure that the movements are fluid and controlled throughout the sequence to maintain proper form and technique.
