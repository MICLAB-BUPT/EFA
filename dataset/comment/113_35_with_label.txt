The sweeping staff action in this video is bad because the person's stance is not stable and they are not using their entire body to generate power. The person should start with a stable stance, such as a horse stance or a bow stance, providing a solid base for the sweeping motion. Additionally, the person's grip on the staff is not firm enough, which can lead to loss of control during the sweep. To improve, the person should work on maintaining a stable stance and gripping the staff firmly with both hands, spaced apart for better control.
