The pull up action in this video is bad. The primary flaw is a significant lack of shoulder stability and latissimus dorsi engagement at the start and throughout the pull. Although the athlete starts from a dead hang, there is no visible scapular retraction or depression (shoulder packing) before or during the ascent, causing the shoulders to remain elevated and shrugging toward the ears. This shifts the effort away from the back muscles and onto the smaller muscles of the arms and upper traps, severely limiting exercise effectiveness. To improve, the athlete must focus on pre-engaging the lats by initiating a scapular pull (depressing the shoulders) from the dead hang before bending the elbows. Additionally, maintaining a neutral head position by looking straight ahead will prevent neck strain.
