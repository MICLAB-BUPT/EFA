The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad. The character starts with a neutral stance but quickly transitions to a thrusting motion without establishing the proper 'Gong Bu' stance. This deviation from the ideal form may compromise balance and control during the thrust, making it less effective. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining the 'Gong Bu' stance throughout the movement, ensuring stability and proper form.
