The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the staff firmly with a firm grip. He then prepares for the lifting action by positioning the staff near the ground or at waist level, ready to generate upward power. As he initiates the lifting motion, his wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff upwards and outwards, demonstrating a controlled and fluid movement. The power generated from the legs and core is transferred through the lifting motion, amplifying the wrist flick. Finally, the character retracts the staff to a guard position, maintaining balance and control throughout the technique. This sequence shows a well-executed lifting and stirring staff form, with precise movements and good coordination between the upper and lower body.
