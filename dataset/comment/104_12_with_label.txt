The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The character starts with a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ), demonstrating a wide stance with knees bent and the core engaged, which is ideal for stability and power. The hand positioning also appears to be correct, with one hand scooping or raking while the other remains in a guard position. The execution of the 'Lou Shou' movement seems controlled and fluid, maintaining the power generated from the 'Ma Bu'. Overall, the character's form and technique are well-executed, making it an effective demonstration of the horse stance gather hand action.
