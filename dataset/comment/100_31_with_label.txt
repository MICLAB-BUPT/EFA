The cloud hands action in this video is bad. The person does not maintain a neutral stance or transitional posture, as they are already in a dynamic position. Their weight shift is abrupt and not continuous, and the hand movements lack coordination and flow. The hands cross directly instead of maintaining a sense of connection and flow. To improve, the person should start from a neutral stance, perform gradual and continuous weight shifts, and execute coordinated circular hand movements that pass each other without crossing directly.
