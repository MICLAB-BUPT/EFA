The knife flourish action in this video is good. The person maintains a firm yet relaxed grip on the Dao (broadsword) and performs controlled, circular motions with precision. They focus on creating clear, distinct patterns with the blade, demonstrating fluidity and control throughout the sequence. Additionally, they practice different variations of the 'Wu Dao Hua' techniques, incorporating them into transitions between other techniques within a Dao form. The overall execution showcases skill and refinement, making it an effective and visually appealing knife flourish.
