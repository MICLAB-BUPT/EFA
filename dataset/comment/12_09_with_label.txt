The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The woman maintains a slight bend in her elbows throughout the exercise, which helps to engage the medial deltoids and avoid locking them out. She keeps her core engaged and maintains an upright posture with her chest up and shoulders back, preventing slouching or leaning forward. Her movement is controlled as she raises the arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. The lowering phase is also controlled, with no signs of dropping the dumbbells. Overall, her technique demonstrates proper form and execution for effective shoulder workouts.
