The knife flourish action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a firm yet relaxed grip on the Dao (broadsword) and maintains a controlled, circular motion of the blade with precision. The wrist and forearm movements are clearly visible, showcasing the practitioner's skill and control. The non-wielding hand is used for balance, enhancing the visual effect of the 'Wu Dao Hua' technique. Additionally, the fluidity and continuous flow of the motion are evident, indicating a well-practiced and refined form.
