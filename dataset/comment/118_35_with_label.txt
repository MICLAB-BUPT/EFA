The wrist flourish action in this video is bad. The person's wrist movement is not fluid and continuous, and the blade does not create a visually appealing 'flower' pattern. The non-wielding hand is not moving in a coordinated manner for balance. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining control of the blade, creating clear, distinct patterns, and coordinating the non-wielding hand with the wrist movement.
