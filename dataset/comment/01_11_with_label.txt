The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person starts by lying on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, ensuring a stable base. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip, which is ideal for stability and control during the lift. The individual unracks the barbell with a controlled movement, maintaining straight arms throughout the process. As they lower the barbell towards their chest, they keep their elbows at roughly a 45-75 degree angle to their body, avoiding flaring them out completely to the sides or tucking them in too close. The person then pushes the barbell back up to the starting position, extending their arms fully while maintaining control, focusing on using chest muscles. The movements are smooth and controlled, with no signs of jerking or excessive momentum, indicating a proper execution of the barbell bench press exercise.
