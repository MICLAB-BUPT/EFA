The sword thrust action in this video is bad. The character does not begin in a balanced stance and does not extend the sword arm forward smoothly, which affects the power and accuracy of the thrust. Additionally, the step forward with the front leg is not coordinated with the arm extension, leading to an unaligned movement. To improve, the character should start in a proper stance, ensure smooth and controlled arm extension, and coordinate the arm and leg movements for better power and accuracy.
