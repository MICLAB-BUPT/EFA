The scissor flourish action in this video is good. The character begins with a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao, and the stance is stable and balanced. The movements are smooth and rhythmic, creating a clear, distinct 'scissor' pattern. The wrist, forearm, and body rotation are used to generate power and control the blade's trajectory. The non-wielding hand moves for balance, maintaining a clear and precise form throughout the practice.
