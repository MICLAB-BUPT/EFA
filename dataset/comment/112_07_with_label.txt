The staff point action in this video is good. The person begins in a stable stance with a firm grip on the staff, demonstrating control and balance. They execute the 'Dian Gun' technique with a quick and precise thrust, using the tip of the staff to strike the target. The power is generated from the ground through the legs and core, ensuring a controlled movement. After completing the 'Dian', they retract the staff quickly to a guard position, maintaining stability throughout the action. These aspects show a well-practiced and refined technique that effectively demonstrates the staff point form.
