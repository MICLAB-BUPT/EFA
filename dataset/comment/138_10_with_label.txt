The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a stable stance and controlled movement, with the sword held naturally and the body maintaining a centered and balanced posture. The upward arc of the sword is smooth and arcing, with the elbow slightly bent and not overly extended. The wrist is used to control the angle and precision of the movement, ensuring the blade's edge faces the direction of the arc. The power comes from the waist rotation, adding fluidity and power to the technique. The character completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position ready for the next intended movement.
