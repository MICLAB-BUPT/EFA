The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a secure grip on the sword and does not execute the 'Pu Bu' (drop step) correctly. Instead of shifting weight onto one leg while extending the other, the character appears to be holding the sword awkwardly and not using their body's core strength effectively. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a secure grip, executing the drop step properly, and using their body's momentum to control the movement of the sword.
