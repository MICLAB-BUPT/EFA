The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form and technique throughout the movement. They start with feet hip-width apart, maintaining a slight bend in the knees and keeping their back straight. The individual then bends at the hips while pushing the hips back, ensuring the bar stays close to the legs. The core is braced, and the hamstrings are engaged as the bar is lowered. The person maintains tension throughout the descent, and the back remains neutral. As the bar reaches its lowest point, the individual drives through the heels, extending the hips and glutes to stand up fully, maintaining a slight knee bend throughout the lift. This sequence of actions ensures a controlled and effective deadlift, adhering to the ideal standards for the exercise.
