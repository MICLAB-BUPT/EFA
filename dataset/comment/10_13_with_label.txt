The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person is lying on a decline bench with their feet securely under the pads, maintaining a position slightly below the barbell when it's racked. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and unrack the barbell with arms extended, keeping wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked. The person lowers the barbell under control, touching it to the lower chest, while maintaining a roughly 45-degree angle to the body. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. Throughout the movement, the person engages their abdominal muscles to stabilize the torso, ensuring a safe and efficient exercise.
