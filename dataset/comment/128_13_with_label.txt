The staff lift action in this video is good. The character starts with a balanced stance, feet shoulder-width apart, ensuring a stable base. The grip on the staff is close to one end, providing leverage for the upward lifting motion. The character slightly lowers their body by bending the knees, preparing to generate upward force, similar to preparing to jump. The character explosively extends the legs and hips upward, driving the force from the ground through the body and into the staff. The arms begin to lift the staff, guiding its upward trajectory, and continue the upward motion of the staff using the arms and wrists to control its direction and angle. The character maintains balance and control throughout the entire movement, even after the staff reaches its peak height.
