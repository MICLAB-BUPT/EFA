The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is bad. The character starts with a solid 'Ma Bu' (horse stance) but then moves into a stance that is wider than shoulder-width apart, which deviates from the ideal form. Additionally, the character's elbows are not bent at the point of impact during the downward chopping motion, and the fists are not angled slightly inwards or downwards as recommended. These deviations suggest that the character may lack proper technique and control, leading to an ineffective execution of the move. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable and powerful base with correct elbow positioning and fist angles during the downward chopping motion.
