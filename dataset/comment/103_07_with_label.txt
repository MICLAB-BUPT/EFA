The horse stance punch action in this video is good. The person maintains a solid horse stance with their feet positioned wide apart, knees bent, and back straight. They initiate the punch with a focus on generating power from the ground, rotating their waist to execute the thrusting motion. The arm is extended forward with a vertical or slightly angled fist aimed at the target. The non-punching hand remains chambered at the waist for balance. The execution of the punch is smooth and controlled, with the person retracting their fist back to the chambered position after delivering it. Overall, the technique is precise and well-coordinated, showcasing proper form and balance throughout the movement.
