The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual starts by lying on their back with the knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. They position the barbell across the hips, resting it in the hip crease. The person's hands are placed on the barbell to stabilize it, ensuring a secure grip. They take a deep breath and brace the core, engaging the abdominal muscles. As they drive through the heels, squeezing the glutes, they lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. The person maintains glute engagement at the top of the bridge before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control. The actions are executed with good form, maintaining proper alignment and muscle engagement throughout the exercise.
