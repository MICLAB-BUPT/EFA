The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper technique and form by starting in a preparatory stance, maintaining balance with a strong 'Gong Bu' posture, and executing the 'Zha Dao' thrust with precision. The arm extension and rotation are smooth, showcasing controlled movement. Additionally, the transition from the initial stance to the thrust appears fluid and well-coordinated. The overall execution of the technique is well-executed, aligning with ideal standards for a bow stance thrusting knife form.
