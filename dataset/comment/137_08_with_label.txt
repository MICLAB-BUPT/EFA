The sword point action in this video is good. The character begins in a balanced and agile stance, ready to move quickly and precisely, holding the sword with a relaxed grip. They initiate a small, controlled step towards the target, using a quick snapping motion of the wrist to flick the tip of the sword forward. Contact is made with the very tip of the sword, emphasizing precision and accuracy, before the character immediately withdraws the sword tip and returns to a ready position.
