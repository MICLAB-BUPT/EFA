The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a strong foundation by standing with their feet shoulder-width apart and maintaining a neutral head position. They also exhibit proper technique by keeping their elbows close to their body during the lift, which ensures efficient use of their back muscles. Furthermore, the person maintains control throughout the descent, preventing any unnecessary momentum or rounding of the back. This combination of foundational strength, technique, and control results in a well-executed barbell bent-over row exercise.
