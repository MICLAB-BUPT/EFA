The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The individual maintains a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise, which helps avoid locking them out and ensures proper muscle engagement. The core is engaged, and the chest is up with shoulders back, demonstrating good posture. The arms are raised out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, following the ideal technique of focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. The individual's movements are controlled, and there is an emphasis on resisting momentum or swinging the dumbbells. Overall, the execution of the exercise is precise and demonstrates a strong understanding of proper form for a dumbbell lateral raise.
