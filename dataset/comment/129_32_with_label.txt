The spear crush action in this video is bad. The character does not start with a stable stance and instead performs the action in a lunge position, which is not ideal for generating power or maintaining balance. This incorrect starting position may result in less force being applied to the spearhead during the thrust. Additionally, the character's posture is poor as they do not maintain proper alignment throughout the motion. To improve this action, the character should begin in a balanced stance that allows for forward movement and power generation, ensuring their body remains aligned and their arms are properly extended during the thrust.
