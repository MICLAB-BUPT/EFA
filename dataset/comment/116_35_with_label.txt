The sword stir action in this video is bad. The character starts by holding the sword incorrectly, with a grip that is too tight and not aligned properly. This can lead to poor control and execution of the movements. Additionally, the character's stance is not stable or neutral, which further compromises their ability to perform the movements accurately. To improve, the character should work on developing a more relaxed and firm grip, ensuring that the sword is held at the correct angle and that the body is positioned correctly for each movement. Practicing these fundamentals will help the character to execute the sword stirs with greater precision and control.
