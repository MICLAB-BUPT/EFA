The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person starts with the barbell positioned on their chest, demonstrating proper form. As they lower the barbell towards their chest, they maintain a controlled motion, which is essential for effective training and injury prevention. The person then pushes the barbell back up to the starting position, ensuring that the arms are fully extended without any violent locking at the elbows. This controlled movement showcases a focus on using chest muscles effectively during the exercise.
