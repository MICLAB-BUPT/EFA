The sword stir action in this video is good. The person maintains a stable stance throughout the performance, with the sword held firmly and relaxedly. They initiate the 'Liao' (upward cutting or raising) action by positioning the sword low near the waist, then execute the upward sweep with power from the ground through the arm to the blade. The finishing position of the sword near the head or shoulder level indicates proper technique. There are no major refinements needed as the character demonstrates a clear understanding of the form's steps and movements.
