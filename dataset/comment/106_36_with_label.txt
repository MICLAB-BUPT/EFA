The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The character begins in a neutral stance, but the execution of the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) is not properly demonstrated as the leg does not bend to approximately 90 degrees and the back leg remains straight with the heel on the ground or slightly raised. The 'Chan Tou' (head-wrapping action) is also not executed correctly, as the movement is not fluid and controlled, and the wrist, forearm, and body rotation are not utilized effectively. The blade of the Dao is not kept close to the head without making contact, which is a fundamental aspect of the technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper footwork, ensuring the 'Gong Bu' is correctly executed, and practicing smooth, controlled movements while wrapping the head with the Dao.
