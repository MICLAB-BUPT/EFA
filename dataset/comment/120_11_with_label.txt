The elbow whip action in this video is good. The person starts in a stable stance, holding the whip firmly and positioning their elbow to redirect its momentum. They execute a series of fluid movements, swinging the whip in circular motions while using their elbow as a pivot point. The technique appears well-coordinated, with the person maintaining control over the whip throughout the sequence.
