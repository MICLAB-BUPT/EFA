The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The man maintains a neutral head position and keeps his back straight throughout the exercise, which helps to engage the target muscles effectively. His elbows are close to his body, and he focuses on squeezing his shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. He also maintains control during the descent, avoiding any momentum or swinging motion that could lead to injury or reduced effectiveness. Overall, the form displayed in the video is well-executed and would be considered good practice for performing the barbell bent-over row.
