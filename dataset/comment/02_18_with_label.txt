The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual maintains a straight back throughout the exercise, which is crucial for avoiding injury and ensuring proper form. They also keep their elbows close to their body as they pull the barbell up towards their torso, demonstrating a controlled movement that engages the target muscles effectively. The person's feet are positioned shoulder-width apart, providing a stable base for the exercise. However, there is room for improvement; the individual could maintain a more neutral head position by looking straight ahead instead of down at the feet, which may enhance their overall balance and reduce unnecessary strain on the neck.
