The rope slide action in this video is bad because the person's movements are not smooth and controlled, which can make it difficult to perform other techniques or maneuvers. The person also seems to be using too much force when releasing the rope, which could lead to strain on their hands and wrists. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a steady grip on the rope and practicing the 'Liu Sheng' technique with more precision and control. They should also work on developing a smoother and more fluid motion when releasing the rope.
