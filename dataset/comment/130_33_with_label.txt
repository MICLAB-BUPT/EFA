The spear point action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a balanced and agile stance, which makes it difficult to execute quick and accurate movements. Additionally, the character's grip on the spear may be too tight, limiting wrist flexibility and control of the spear tip. The step or shift towards the target is smaller and faster than ideal, but there is no clear indication of where the target is located. The extension of the spear arm is quick, but the snapping motion is not focused enough on striking the target precisely. Finally, the retraction of the spear after making contact is not immediate, which could leave the character vulnerable to counter-attacks. To improve, the character should work on maintaining proper balance, grip, and focus throughout the movement.
