The spinning whip action in this video is good. The person maintains a stable stance and holds the handle firmly, ensuring the whip chain is extended and ready for deployment. They initiate the turning motion of the body with fluidity and control, generating momentum through their core strength. As they turn, they begin to swing the whip, using the body's rotation to generate initial force. The person continues the turning motion while swinging the whip, maintaining balance and control throughout the sequence. The whip is brought to a controlled stop, demonstrating precision and skill in executing the technique.
