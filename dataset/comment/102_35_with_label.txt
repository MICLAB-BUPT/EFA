The bow stance punch action in this video is bad. The character starts in a wide stance with the left foot forward, which is incorrect as it should be the right foot forward for proper form. The right arm is extended to the side, but the punch is not initiated from the waist and driven by body rotation. Instead, the arm is swung forward, which lacks power and control. The non-punching hand remains in a guard position, but it does not retract to the waist as it should after the punch. These deviations result in an ineffective and uncontrolled punch. To improve, the character should start with the right foot forward, initiate the punch from the waist with body rotation, and retract the non-punching hand to the waist after the punch.
