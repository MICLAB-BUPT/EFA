The cross drape red action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, and there are abrupt transitions between the vertical and horizontal components of the cross pattern. The wrist, forearm, and body movements lack control and precision, resulting in an unnatural flow of motion. To improve, the character should practice smoother and more controlled swings, focusing on maintaining a consistent rhythm and fluidity throughout the sequence.
