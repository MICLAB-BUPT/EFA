The left and right shuttle action in this video is good. The person begins in a relaxed, centered position with the body prepared for shifting and turning. They then shift their weight onto one leg, preparing to step diagonally forward and outward into a bow stance, similar to 'Ye Ma Fen Zong'. As they step, they perform a ward-off and pushing motion with their arms, one arm moving forward and outward while the other pushes forward. This creates a diagonal line of force as they complete the bow stance. Finally, the person repeats the movement on the opposite side, shifting weight, stepping diagonally with the other leg, and performing the ward-off and push with the opposite arms. This alternating movement from side to side is the 'Zuo You' aspect of 'Chuan Suo'. Overall, the person demonstrates good form and technique throughout the sequence, making it an effective demonstration of the left and right shuttle action.
