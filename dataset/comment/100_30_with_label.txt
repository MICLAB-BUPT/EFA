The cloud hands action in this video is bad. The character starts with an incorrect stance, as they are not centered and balanced. Their weight distribution is uneven, and their knees are not bent enough. Additionally, the hand movements are not coordinated and circular; instead, they appear jerky and disjointed. To improve, the character should begin by centering themselves and distributing their weight evenly, bending their knees slightly. They should also practice smooth, continuous hand movements that flow together, focusing on the waist's coordination with the weight shift.
