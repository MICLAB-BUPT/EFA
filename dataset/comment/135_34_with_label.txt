The downward staff chop action in this video is bad because the person is not demonstrating proper form. The individual is holding the nunchaku with one hand, which is incorrect as it should be held with both hands for stability and control. Additionally, there is no visible rotation of the body or core engagement during the swing, which is crucial for generating power. The follow-through is also not evident, indicating a lack of control over the motion. To improve, the person should hold the nunchaku with both hands, rotate their body using the hips and core, and ensure a smooth follow-through to maximize the effectiveness and safety of the technique.
