The left and right shuttle action in this video is bad. The person starts by shifting their weight onto one leg, preparing to step, but they do not turn their body towards the stepping leg as they step diagonally forward and outward. This results in an incomplete bow stance, with the front knee not bending over the ankle and the back leg extended. Additionally, the arms are not positioned correctly; one arm moves forward and outward in a warding-off action while the other hand is not pushed forward as it should be. To improve this action, the person should ensure that they turn their body towards the stepping leg, properly position their arms during the ward-off and push motions, and maintain the correct form of the bow stance.
