The sword sweep action in this video is bad. The character starts with an incorrect stance, not centered and balanced. There is no proper rotation from the waist and hips, and the arm movement lacks power. The blade angle is not consistent throughout the sweep, and the stepping motion is uncontrolled. To improve, the character should start in a stable stance, initiate the sweep from the waist and hips, maintain a consistent blade angle, and execute a controlled stepping motion to increase reach and power.
