The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains a proper grip, with their hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and using a full grip. They also keep their wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked during the unracking process. Furthermore, the person lowers the barbell under control to their lower chest and pushes it back up to the starting position while maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. The core and glutes are engaged throughout the movement, contributing to an effective and controlled exercise routine.
