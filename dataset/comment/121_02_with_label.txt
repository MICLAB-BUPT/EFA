The rope slide action in this video is good. The person demonstrates a secure grip on the rope, which allows for precise control of the movement. They initiate the 'Liu Sheng' by allowing the rope to slide through their hand smoothly and at an appropriate speed. The individual also maintains a firm but controlled hold on the rope, ensuring that the hammer head remains under their control throughout the motion. These actions contribute to a well-executed rope slide technique.
