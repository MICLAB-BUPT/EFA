The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a strong grip with an overhand or mixed grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, maintaining a neutral spine and engaging the abdominal muscles and lats to brace the core. They lower the barbell by pushing the hips back, keeping the bar close to the legs and maintaining a slight bend in the knees, demonstrating proper form. The individual also stands up fully at the top while maintaining tension in the hamstrings and a neutral spine, avoiding hyperextension. Overall, the execution of the deadlift is precise and controlled, reflecting good technique.
