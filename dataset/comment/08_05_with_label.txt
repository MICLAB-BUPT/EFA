The barbell front squat action in this video is good. The person starts with the barbell resting across their shoulders, close to the throat, supported by the anterior deltoids. They maintain an upright torso, keeping the chest up and the elbows high throughout the exercise. The person also takes a deep breath and braces the core, creating intra-abdominal pressure to support the spine. Additionally, they initiate the squat by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously, keeping the torso as upright as possible. The person then drives through the heels, extending the hips and knees to return to the starting position while maintaining a consistent, upright torso throughout the ascent.
