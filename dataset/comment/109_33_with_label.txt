The knife flourish action in this video is bad because the person is not holding the sword properly, and their movements are not fluid or controlled. The person's grip on the sword is too loose, and their motions are jerky, which can lead to accidents or injuries. To improve, the person should practice holding the sword firmly but comfortably, with their fingers wrapped around the handle and their thumb resting on top of the blade. They should also focus on developing smooth, continuous movements that flow from one motion to the next, rather than jerky or choppy motions.
