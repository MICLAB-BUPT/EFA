The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits excessive full-body momentum, specifically utilizing a pronounced backward lean and hip thrust (a "cheat" or "power" curl) to initiate the lift. This technique reduces the isolation of the biceps and transfers stress to the lower back. The elbows also drift forward excessively, reducing peak biceps contraction. Furthermore, the eccentric (lowering) phase is too fast, indicating poor control and missing out on the muscle-building benefits of the negative. To perform a proper standing barbell curl, the athlete must maintain a fixed, vertical torso and stable hips, ensuring the upper arm remains stationary. The barbell should be lowered slowly and under control, taking at least two to three seconds for the eccentric phase.
