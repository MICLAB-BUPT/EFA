The staff chop action in this video is bad. The character starts with a wide stance, but does not initiate the downward striking motion as expected. Instead of executing the 'Pi' ( pi ), the character does not generate power from the ground and transfer it through the arms to the staff. The non-wielding hand is not used for balance or to contribute to the downward momentum. To improve, the character should begin in a stable stance, raise the Nangun above the head, coil the body, and then drive the staff downwards with force and precision.
