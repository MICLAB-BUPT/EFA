The left and right chopping knife action in this video is bad. The character's movements lack precision and control, which are crucial for executing the 'Pi Dao' correctly. The grip on the sword appears loose, and the transitions between the two sides are abrupt rather than fluid. Improvements could include a more deliberate and controlled grip, smoother transitions between the left and right side chops, and better balance to maintain a consistent form throughout the sequence.
