The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad because the individual is not following proper form and technique. The person's arms are raised at an angle that is not parallel to the floor, which could lead to ineffective muscle engagement and potential injury. To improve this exercise, the individual should focus on keeping their elbows slightly bent and the chest up while raising the arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor. This will ensure that the medial deltoids are engaged effectively and minimize the risk of injury.
