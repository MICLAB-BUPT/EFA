The cross drape red action in this video is bad. The character exhibits poor technique and control throughout the sequence, leading to an overall lack of precision and fluidity. In the initial stance, the character's grip on the Liuxingchui is not secure, resulting in an unstable base for the performance. The execution of the 'Shi Zi' pattern is also lacking, with the hammer head swinging erratically and the rope being untaut, indicating a failure to maintain proper control. The vertical component is performed with abrupt movements, and the horizontal swing is rushed, further diminishing the smoothness and continuity of the technique. Lastly, the combination of the vertical and horizontal swings, known as 'Shi Zi Pi Hong', is executed in a disjointed manner, without a seamless flow that would be characteristic of a well-practiced cross drape red. To improve, the character should focus on refining their grip, improving the stability of their stance, and working on smoother, more controlled movements that would result in a more aesthetically pleasing and technically sound performance.
