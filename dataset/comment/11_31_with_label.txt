The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain proper form throughout the exercise, as indicated by the elbows being too high and not close to the torso, which can lead to increased strain on the shoulders and back. To improve this, the character should focus on keeping the elbows close to the body and using controlled movements during the curl.
