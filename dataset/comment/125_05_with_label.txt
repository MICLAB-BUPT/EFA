The staff parry action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, which is essential for maintaining balance and control during the technique. The grip on the Nangun (Southern Staff) appears firm, ensuring precision in the movement. Although the sequence is brief, the quick, controlled movement of the staff to redirect an incoming attack demonstrates good technique. The character's body shifts slightly to align with the intended direction of the deflection, showcasing an understanding of proper form. The focus on precision and timing rather than brute force is evident, making the 'Bo Gun' technique effective.
