The barbell bent-over row action in this video is bad. The athlete demonstrates poor biomechanical execution characterized by excessive lumbar rounding and insufficient hip hinging at the start of the movement, which positions the torso too vertically (approximately 55 degrees from horizontal). This upright position compromises the leverage required for optimal lat engagement and unnecessarily stresses the posterior chain. During the pulling phase, the athlete fails to maintain a fixed back angle, exhibiting noticeable movement and a slight upward lift of the torso, transforming the bent-over row into a less effective power/cheat row. To correct these faults, the athlete must initiate the lift with a deeper hip hinge, maintain a rigidly neutral spine (avoiding lumbar flexion), and hold a consistent torso angle (ideally 30-45 degrees) throughout the entire repetition, ensuring the pull is driven by the elbows retracting toward the hips.
