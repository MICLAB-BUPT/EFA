The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is bad. The character's knees are not deeply bent, which is a deviation from the ideal form where the thighs should be parallel to the ground. Additionally, the fists are not positioned correctly for the downward chopping motion; they are not brought up to a guard position or chambered at the waist as per the ideal technique. This improper positioning and form can lead to reduced power and stability during the execution of the technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining the correct knee bend and bringing the fists into the proper position before initiating the downward chopping strikes.
