The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form throughout the exercise, with a neutral spine and chest up. He starts with the barbell resting across his upper back, takes a deep breath to brace his core, and then squats down with his hips and knees bending simultaneously. He maintains a consistent back angle during the descent and drives through his heels to return to the starting position. The execution of the exercise is fluid and controlled, indicating a well-executed barbell back squat.
