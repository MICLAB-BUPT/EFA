The nunchaku flourish action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a firm yet relaxed grip on the handle of the nunchaku, which allows for smooth and continuous movements. The controlled wrist, arm, and shoulder rotations are evident as the character swings the free handle in circular patterns, showcasing fluidity and precision. Additionally, the transitions between different planes of motion, such as around the body and over the shoulders, add complexity to the performance. While the video only shows a brief segment, it captures the essence of a well-executed nunchaku flourish, with emphasis on technique and form.
