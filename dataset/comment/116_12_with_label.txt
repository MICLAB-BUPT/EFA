The sword stir action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the sword with a firm but relaxed grip, positioning it low near the waist or thigh, and then initiating the upward sweeping cut with power from the ground through the legs and core. The movement is executed with precision, maintaining balance and control throughout the action. The transition to the next movement is also well-executed, showcasing fluidity and grace in the form. Overall, the performance demonstrates good technique and skill in sword handling.
