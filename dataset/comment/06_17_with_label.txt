The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by standing with feet hip-width apart, gripping the bar with an overhand or mixed grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, and maintaining a neutral spine throughout the exercise. They hinge at the hips, push back while bending the knees slightly, brace their core, and lower the bar until it reaches the point where it touches the ground. The individual then drives through the heels to stand up fully at the top of the lift, maintaining a slight knee bend. There are no visible signs of rounding the spine or hyperextension, indicating that the technique is executed correctly.
