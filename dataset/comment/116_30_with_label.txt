The sword stir action in this video is bad. The character performs the sword stir with poor form, starting from an incorrect stance and executing the movement without proper technique. The character's movements are not fluid or controlled, and the grip on the sword is not firm but relaxed. This lack of control and form can lead to potential injuries and is not ideal for performing a sword stir. To improve, the character should focus on developing proper form and technique, including maintaining a stable stance, gripping the sword firmly, and executing the movement with precision and control.
