The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual is lying on an inclined bench, maintaining proper form with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and elbows tucked in at a 45-75 degree angle to the body. They also engage their core during the exercise, push the barbell back up to the starting position, and maintain control throughout the movement.
