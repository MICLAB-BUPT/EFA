The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is bad. The athlete is not performing a triceps extension but rather a dumbbell pullover, which targets the lats and chest rather than the triceps. The dumbbells are lowered by flexing at the shoulder joint, moving the upper arms backward past the head, instead of strictly flexing at the elbow joint. Furthermore, the athlete maintains an arched lower back, breaking core tension and placing unnecessary strain on the lumbar spine. To correct this, the athlete should ensure the upper arms remain perpendicular to the floor and the movement is purely elbow flexion/extension (for triceps extension). If performing a pullover, the core should be braced, and the spine should remain neutral to protect the lower back.
