The knife flourish action in this video is bad. The character in the video does not maintain a firm yet relaxed grip on the Dao (broadsword) and instead uses both hands to perform the motion, which is less efficient and controlled compared to using one hand. This deviation from the ideal step of using only one hand to perform the motion results in a less precise and fluid execution of the 'Wu Dao Hua' technique. To improve, the character should practice using only one hand while maintaining a steady grip and focus on creating clear, distinct patterns with the moving blade.
