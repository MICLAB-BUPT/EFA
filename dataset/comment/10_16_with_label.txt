The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person is lying on a decline bench with feet secured under the pads, and their eyes are positioned slightly below the barbell when it's racked, ensuring a safe and efficient unrack. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using a full grip (thumb wrapped around the bar), which is appropriate for a decline bench press. The person unracks the barbell with arms extended, keeping wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked, taking a deep breath and bracing the core to stabilize the torso. The person lowers the barbell under control, touching it to the lower chest (near the bottom of the sternum), keeping the elbows tucked in, maintaining a roughly 45-degree angle to the body. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top, exhaling forcefully during the upward push, and keeping the core and glutes engaged throughout the movement.
