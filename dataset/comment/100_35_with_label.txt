The cloud hands action in this video is bad. The person begins with an incorrect stance, not centered and balanced. They also perform the movements with abrupt and unnatural motions rather than a continuous, flowing sequence. Additionally, their arms are not moving in a coordinated, circular motion as described in the ideal steps. To improve, the person should start from a neutral stance, maintain balance and coordination, and practice the movements with fluidity and control.
