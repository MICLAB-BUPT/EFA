The wrist flourish action in this video is bad. The individual's movements are not fluid and continuous, and the blade does not create a visually appealing 'flower' pattern. Additionally, the person's upper arm is moving more than necessary, which detracts from the elegance of the technique. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining control of the blade, creating clear and distinct patterns, and keeping the upper arm relatively still while practicing different variations of the wrist flourish.
