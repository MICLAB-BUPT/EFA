The downward staff chop action in this video is bad. The character in the video does not follow through with the motion properly, which can lead to a loss of balance and control. Additionally, there is no visible rotation of the hips and core, indicating that the power generation from the lower body is not being utilized effectively. To improve this action, the character should ensure proper follow-through, engage their core and hips during the motion, and maintain a stable stance throughout the exercise.
