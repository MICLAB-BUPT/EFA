The pull up action in this video is good. The individual maintains a controlled grip on the bar, starts from a dead hang position, and engages their back and shoulder muscles to perform the pull-up. Their shoulders are pulled down and back, and they maintain a neutral head position throughout the movement. The chin reaches above the bar, demonstrating proper form. There is no swinging or kipping, ensuring a smooth and controlled motion.
