The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual lies on the bench with their feet flat, eyes aligned with the barbell, and grips it slightly wider than shoulder-width apart using an overhand grip. They unrack the barbell carefully, positioning it directly over their chest with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle. The descent is controlled and steady, reaching the lower chest or slightly below, while the push-up maintains a smooth and powerful motion. Overall, the technique is executed with proper form and minimal deviations from ideal standards.
