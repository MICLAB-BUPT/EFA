The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is bad. The most critical error is the athlete's failure to maintain a neutral spine, exhibiting significant lumbar rounding (flexion) at the bottom of the movement. This technique uses the lower back muscles to achieve depth rather than isolating the hamstrings and glutes, substantially increasing the risk of injury, particularly since the athlete is standing on blocks, increasing the stretch. The knees are also overly bent, making this technically closer to a regular Romanian Deadlift, yet the spinal flexion remains the primary issue. To correct this, the athlete must tightly brace the core, initiate the movement by pushing the hips back (hip hinge), and stop the descent the moment any rounding of the lower back occurs, maintaining a flat back to prioritize hamstring stretch and safety.
