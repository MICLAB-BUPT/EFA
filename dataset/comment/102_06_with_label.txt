The bow stance punch action in this video is good. The character maintains a balanced stance with their feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, which helps in distributing the weight evenly. They step forward with one leg, bending the front knee to approximately 90 degrees while keeping the back leg straight, establishing the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance). Simultaneously, they initiate the punch ('Chu Quan',  chu quan ) with the opposite hand of the front leg. The punch originates from the waist and is driven by the rotation of the body, extending the punching arm forward aiming for the target. The character also retracts the fist after the punch and returns to the 'Gong Bu' or transitions into another technique. The focus on maintaining balance and control throughout the movement ensures that the power generated from the stance and the body rotation is effectively utilized.
