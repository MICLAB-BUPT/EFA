The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad. The character starts with the thumbs pointing slightly down, which is incorrect as it should be aimed forward. Additionally, the elbows are not bent enough, which means the movement is not controlled and may not effectively target the medial deltoids. To improve, the character should ensure the thumbs are pointing straight ahead and bend their elbows to a slight angle while maintaining control throughout the exercise.
