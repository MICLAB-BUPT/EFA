The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form by lying on a flat bench with their feet flat on the floor, ensuring a stable base. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip, which is ideal for chest development. The person unracks the barbell carefully and positions it directly over their chest, with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle to their body. The descent towards the chest is controlled and steady, touching the barbell around the nipple line or slightly below. Finally, the person pushes the barbell back up to the starting position with a controlled and steady pressing motion, focusing on using chest muscles.
