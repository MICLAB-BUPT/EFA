The sweeping staff action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not stable and the body does not coil slightly to store potential energy, which makes it difficult to generate power for the sweep. Additionally, the Gun is not held with a firm grip and the arms do not guide the staff properly, leading to an incomplete sweep. To improve, the character should start in a stable stance, coil their body, and hold the Gun firmly with both hands while guiding it with their arms during the sweep.
