The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The person maintains a straight back, engaged core, and chest up throughout the exercise. They keep their elbows higher than their wrists, which helps avoid excessive stress on the shoulder joints. The person pulls the barbell up to chest level or slightly below, showing proper technique. While they do not fully extend their arms at the top of the movement, it is a small deviation that does not significantly impact the overall quality of the exercise.
