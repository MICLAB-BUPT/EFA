The staff parry action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, with a firm grip on the Nangun, preparing for the 'Bo' action. They execute the 'Bo Gun' quickly and with control, using the strength of their stance to redirect an incoming attack. After the 'Bo,' they transition into another technique, maintaining balance and control throughout the sequence. This showcases precision, timing, and a strong foundation in martial arts technique.
