The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The person maintains a straight back and engaged core throughout the exercise, which is ideal for proper form and reducing strain on the spine. The elbows lead the movement out and up to the sides, following the correct technique. The barbell is lifted to chest level or slightly below, adhering to the guideline of avoiding excessive height. However, there is no clear indication of the barbell being pulled down slowly with control; this would be a minor refinement to enhance the performance further.
