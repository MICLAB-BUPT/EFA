The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is bad. The character does not start in a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ), with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. Instead, the character stands straight with their arms down at their sides. This deviation from the ideal starting position could affect the power and stability of the subsequent movements. Additionally, the character's posture is upright, which might not provide enough support for the arm swings and the downward chopping motion. To improve, the character should ensure they begin in the correct 'Ma Bu' stance, maintaining proper alignment and balance throughout the sequence.
