The downward staff chop action in this video is bad because the person does not demonstrate proper form or technique. The individual's movements are quick and jerky, which may not provide an effective strike or control over the nunchaku. This lack of control could result in an injury to the person or a less precise strike. To improve, the person should focus on a smooth, controlled motion that involves generating power from the hips and core, maintaining balance with the free hand, and following through after impact.
