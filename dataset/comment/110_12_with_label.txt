The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The person demonstrates proper form and technique by starting with a preparatory stance, holding the Dao with a relaxed grip, and then executing the 'Pi Dao' with a smooth and controlled motion. The movement involves generating power from the ground and transferring it through the arm to the blade, which shows good control and balance. Additionally, the person transitions between the left and right chops with precision, maintaining a continuous flow of motion. Overall, the character's actions are well-executed, demonstrating a solid understanding of the Dao form and its application.
