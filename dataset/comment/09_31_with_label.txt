The incline barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The character starts with the barbell positioned above their chest, which is not ideal as it should be at shoulder height when unracking. The elbows are flared out to the sides, deviating from the 45-75 degree angle recommendation. Additionally, the character's form appears to be less than optimal, possibly due to insufficient core engagement or improper shoulder positioning. To improve, the character should start with the barbell at shoulder height and ensure the elbows maintain a more controlled angle during the movement.
