The sweeping staff action in this video is bad. The character starts with a stable stance but quickly loses balance, leading to an uncontrolled and unstable motion. The grip on the staff is not firm, and the body's coiling is not well executed, resulting in poor energy transfer. The sweeping motion lacks fluidity and control, and the finishing position is not stable or balanced. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, ensuring a firm grip, and executing controlled movements with proper energy transfer throughout the technique.
