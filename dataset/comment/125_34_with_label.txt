The staff parry action in this video is bad. The character does not maintain a stable stance and his grip on the staff is not firm, which is crucial for balance and control. Additionally, the movement of the staff is not quick or controlled, indicating poor timing and precision. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a strong stance, gripping the staff firmly, and executing swift, precise movements.
