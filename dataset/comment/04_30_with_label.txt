The barbell deadlift action in this video is bad. The athlete executes the lift with nearly locked knees, resembling a stiff-legged deadlift, but exceeds their range of motion by attempting to touch the floor. This forces severe rounding of the lumbar and thoracic spine at the bottom position, placing dangerous shear forces on the vertebral discs. Furthermore, the bar drifts away from the legs, increasing leverage on the lower back, and the neck is hyperextended, breaking neutral spinal alignment. To correct this, the athlete must bend the knees and drop the hips to establish a flat back before pulling, ensure the bar remains in contact with the legs throughout the movement, and tuck the chin to align the cervical spine.
