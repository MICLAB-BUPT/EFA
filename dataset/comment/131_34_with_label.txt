The spear twist action in this video is bad. The character's grip on the spear is not firm enough, and they are not maintaining constant pressure and control during the twisting motion. Additionally, the contact point with the opponent's weapon is not optimal, which compromises the effectiveness of the technique. To improve, the character should focus on a firmer grip, better contact point, and smoother, deliberate force application to execute the spear twist effectively.
