The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person is lying face up on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart, which is the correct starting position for a barbell glute bridge. They have placed the barbell across their hips, resting it in the hip crease, using a pad or folded towel to make it more comfortable. Their hands are placed on the barbell to stabilize it, ensuring a secure grip. The person has taken a deep breath and braced their core, engaging their abdominal muscles, which is crucial for maintaining proper form during the exercise. They are driving through their heels, squeezing their glutes to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. The person maintains glute engagement during the hold at the top of the movement and then slowly lowers the hips back down to the floor with control, avoiding letting the hips drop quickly or touching the ground forcefully. Overall, the person's technique appears to be well-executed, demonstrating proper form and control throughout the exercise.
