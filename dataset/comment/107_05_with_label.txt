The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance with the sword held firmly but relaxedly, ready for the thrust. As they transition into the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance), one leg steps forward while maintaining a 90-degree bend and the other leg remains straight with the heel on the ground, providing stability. Simultaneously, the character initiates the 'Zha Dao' (thrusting action) by extending their arm holding the sword forward, aiming the tip of the blade towards the target. The thrust is executed with power and precision, driven by the extension of the arm, rotation of the waist, and forward momentum of the stance. After the thrust, the character retracts the sword back to a guard position or transitions into another technique, maintaining the 'Gong Bu' throughout. These actions demonstrate good form and control, aligning well with the ideal standards for performing a bow stance thrusting knife.
