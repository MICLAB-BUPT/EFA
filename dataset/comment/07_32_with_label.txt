The barbell back squat action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits a significant kinematic flaw known as "stripper squat," where the hips rise much faster than the chest during the ascent. This shifts the load excessively onto the lower back and compromises the intended quad and glute work. Additionally, the athlete experiences a dramatic forward lean in the torso, indicating weak core bracing and poor movement stability. The overall descent depth is adequate, but the upward compensation is hazardous. To correct this, the athlete needs to maintain a constant back angle relative to the floor until the bar passes the sticking point, ensuring the hips and shoulders rise simultaneously. They must also focus on maintaining a tight core brace and driving the hips directly up rather than back, to keep the torso angle consistent.
