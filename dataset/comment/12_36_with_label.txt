The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad because the individual's elbows are not bent at the beginning of the exercise. Proper form for a lateral raise requires starting with a slight bend in the elbows to ensure proper muscle engagement and prevent injury. Additionally, the individual's posture is upright with the chest up and shoulders back, which is good, but the lack of elbow bend indicates that the movement might not be optimal for muscle development. To improve, the person should maintain a slight bend in their elbows throughout the exercise.
