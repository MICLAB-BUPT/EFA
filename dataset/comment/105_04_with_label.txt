The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The character starts in a solid horse stance with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and knees deeply bent, maintaining stability throughout the movement. Both hands are positioned correctly for downward chopping strikes, and the power is generated from the core and the downward movement of the arms. The character initiates the double chopping fists by bringing both fists down forcefully towards a target, with elbows slightly bent at the point of impact. The fists are angled slightly downwards, and the character maintains the horse stance after the strikes. The character's movements are fluid and controlled, demonstrating precision and strength.
