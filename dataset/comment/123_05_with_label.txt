The back flourish action in this video is good. The character maintains a firm but relaxed grip on the handle of the Nandao and positions it behind their back to execute the circular or figure-eight motion. The movements are fluid and continuous, showcasing control over the blade. Additionally, the non-wielding hand moves in coordination for balance. The character's stance remains stable throughout the action, ensuring a well-executed technique. There are no apparent flaws in the execution of the 'Bei Hua' (back flower) technique, as described in the ideal steps.
