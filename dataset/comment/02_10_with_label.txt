The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The person starts with their feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Their knees are slightly bent, and they maintain a straight back while looking slightly ahead. They hinge at the hips, pushing their hips back and lowering their torso until it's almost parallel to the floor, which shows proper hip and torso positioning. The barbell is hung straight down from their shoulders with arms fully extended, indicating the starting position. They then pull the barbell up towards their lower chest or upper abdomen, keeping their elbows close to their body, demonstrating effective core engagement. Lastly, they slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent, which ensures proper muscle engagement and safety during the exercise.
