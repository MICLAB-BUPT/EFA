The rope slide action in this video is bad. The person's grip on the rope is not secure enough, which can lead to difficulty controlling the movement of the rope during a swing or throw. Additionally, there is a lack of smoothness and precision in the 'Liu Sheng' technique, as indicated by the inconsistent speed and tension of the rope. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a secure grip, controlling the length and tension of the rope, and practicing the 'Liu Sheng' with gradual increases in speed and complexity.
