The horse stance punch action in this video is good. The individual maintains a wide stance with their feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, ensuring stability and balance. Their knees are deeply bent, and the back is straight, with the core engaged, which is ideal for generating power from the ground through the legs and core. The chambered hand at the waist indicates proper hand positioning for balance and control. The arm extends forward in a thrusting motion, aiming for the target level, demonstrating a clear and focused execution of the punch. Overall, the performer maintains a solid Ma Bu throughout the punch, highlighting good form and technique.
