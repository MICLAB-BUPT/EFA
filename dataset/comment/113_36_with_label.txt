The sweeping staff action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not stable and balanced, which is crucial for maintaining control during the sweeping motion. Additionally, the grip on the staff is not firm enough, leading to a lack of precision in the movements. To improve, the character should focus on achieving a stable stance with a firm grip, ensuring that the body cools slightly to store potential energy before initiating the sweep. This will allow for a more controlled and powerful execution of the technique.
