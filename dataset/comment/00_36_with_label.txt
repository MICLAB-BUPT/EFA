The pull up action in this video is bad. The primary technical fault is the significant hyperextension of the lower back (arching) and forward translation of the hips during the ascent, which compromises the straight body line essential for a strict pull-up. This indicates insufficient core tension and glute engagement, leading the athlete to rely on spinal compensation instead of maximizing lat and upper back strength. Furthermore, there is a visible forward head posture at the peak of the pull. To correct these deviations, the athlete must actively engage the core and glutes to maintain a hollow body position (slight posterior pelvic tilt) throughout the entire movement. They should practice starting the pull by focusing on scapular depression and retraction before bending the elbows, ensuring the pull is purely vertical and the head remains neutral.
