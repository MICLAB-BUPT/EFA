The parting the wild horse's mane action in this video is bad. The character starts by standing in a wide stance, but their arms are not positioned correctly for the movement. They shift their weight onto one leg and step diagonally forward, but their hands are not separated as they should be. The character's arms move in a circular motion, but the forward hand is not extended properly. The bow stance is not fully formed, with the front knee not bent enough and the back leg not fully extended. The character holds the posture momentarily, but it is not clear if they are maintaining a relaxed but alert state. To improve, the character should start with the correct arm positions, separate their hands, and form the bow stance correctly. They should also ensure that their body is aligned and their energy is flowing.
