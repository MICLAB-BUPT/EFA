The staff lift action in this video is bad. The character starts with a balanced stance, but the grip on the staff is not ideal as it is closer to one end, which can affect the control and stability of the lift. The body is slightly lowered, but the explosive extension of the legs and hips is not fully demonstrated, leading to a less powerful lift. The arms begin to lift the staff, but the upward motion is not smooth or controlled, indicating a lack of technique. To improve, the character should ensure a proper grip on the staff, maintain balance and control throughout the lift, and demonstrate a more powerful and controlled upward motion.
