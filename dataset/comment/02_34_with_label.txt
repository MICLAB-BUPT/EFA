The barbell bent-over row action in this video is bad. The athlete's execution is compromised by an insufficient initial setup, specifically the lack of a deep, strong hip hinge, which causes the torso to be too upright (approximately 50 degrees from horizontal) throughout the movement, significantly diminishing lat activation. During the pull, there is a visible lack of spinal rigidity, particularly an extension in the lumbar spine, which risks placing undue stress on the lower back. Furthermore, the athlete is pulling the bar towards the upper chest/shoulders rather than the abdomen, indicating excessive bicep and upper trapezius involvement, rather than the intended back musculature. To fix this, the athlete must prioritize pushing the hips further back and maintaining a neutral spine angle closer to parallel with the floor (30-45 degrees), focusing the pull by driving the elbows toward the hips, and ensuring core bracing throughout the entire repetition.
