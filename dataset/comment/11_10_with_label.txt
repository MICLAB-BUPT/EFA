The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The man maintains a proper grip with his hands slightly wider than hip-width and his elbows close to the torso, which helps stabilize the body and reduce unnecessary swinging. He also engages his core and braces it before initiating the movement, ensuring better control over the barbell. The lifting phase of the curl is executed with a controlled motion, focusing on squeezing the biceps at the top of the movement. The lowering phase is also done slowly and under control, minimizing the risk of injury and optimizing muscle engagement. Overall, the man demonstrates good form throughout the exercise, making it an effective and safe workout.
