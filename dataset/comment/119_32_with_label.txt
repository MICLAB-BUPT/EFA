The spinning whip action in this video is bad because the person is not using proper technique. They are swinging the whip in a haphazard manner, which can lead to accidents and injuries. To improve, the person should practice rotating their body while holding the whip in a controlled manner, ensuring that they maintain balance and control throughout the entire sequence. This will help them perform the whip movements more safely and effectively.
