The left and right chopping knife action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid or controlled, and there is a lack of proper form and technique. The chop is executed with too much force, causing the blade to wobble and not maintain a consistent angle. Additionally, the transitions between chops are abrupt and do not flow smoothly from one side to the other. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a relaxed grip, generating power from the ground, and ensuring that the blade maintains a consistent angle throughout the chop.
