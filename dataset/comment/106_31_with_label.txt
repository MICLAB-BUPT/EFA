The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The character begins with the Dao held at their side, which is not in line with the preparatory stance of a neutral grip or transitioning from a previous movement. The character's steps forward into the 'Gong Bu' are also not executed correctly; the front knee should be aligned over the ankle, and the back leg should remain straight with the heel on the ground (or slightly raised). Additionally, the character does not perform the 'Chan Tou' motion correctly; they initiate the circular or figure-eight motion around the head without maintaining control and fluidity of the movement, and they do not keep the blade close to the head as instructed. To improve, the character should start with a proper grip on the Dao, ensure correct footwork, and execute the 'Chan Tou' motion with controlled and fluid movements while keeping the blade close to the head.
