The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance, holding the broadsword with a firm grip and transitioning into the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with one leg forward and the other leg bent at approximately 90 degrees. Simultaneously, the character initiates the 'Zha Dao' (thrusting action) by extending the arm holding the broadsword forward, aiming the tip of the blade towards the target. The execution of the thrust is powerful and precise, driven by the extension of the arm, the rotation of the waist, and the forward momentum of the 'Gong Bu.' The transition from the thrust to a guard position or another technique is also smooth and controlled. Overall, the character maintains a stable base throughout the movement, showcasing good form and technique.
