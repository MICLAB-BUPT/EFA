The bow stance punch action in this video is bad. The character does not properly establish the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with their feet approximately shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Additionally, they do not initiate the punch simultaneously with the stance; instead, they step forward and then perform the punch, which can lead to a less powerful and controlled movement. To improve, the character should ensure that their feet are correctly positioned and that they initiate the punch at the same time as establishing the stance for better balance and power generation.
