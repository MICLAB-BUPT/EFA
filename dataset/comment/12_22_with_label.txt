The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The character stands with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing the body and maintains a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise. He keeps his core engaged and maintains an upright posture with the chest up and shoulders back, avoiding slouching or leaning forward. As he raises the arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, he focuses on lifting with the medial deltoids while keeping control of the movement. Finally, he slowly lowers the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control and resisting the urge to drop them. These actions align with the ideal steps provided for performing a proper lateral raise exercise.
