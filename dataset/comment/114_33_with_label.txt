The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is bad because the person is not performing it with proper form. The execution of the technique is not smooth, and there are noticeable deviations from the ideal steps. First, the stance is not stable or well-formed, which affects balance and control. Second, the wrist flick is not executed correctly, as the motion appears stiff and not fluid. Lastly, the follow-up movements after the lift and flick are not well-coordinated. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a stable stance, using proper hand positioning, and executing fluid wrist flicks to achieve a more effective and controlled staff technique.
