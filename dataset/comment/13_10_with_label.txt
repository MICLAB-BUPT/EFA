The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual starts by lying face up on the bench, holding dumbbells with palms facing each other and elbows slightly bent to avoid locking them out. They then maintain a stable torso while keeping the upper arms stationary throughout the exercise. The individual lowers the dumbbells towards the forehead, bending the elbows, and extends the arms back to the starting position, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement. There is proper control and emphasis on the triceps during the exercise.
