The knife flourish action in this video is bad. The character's grip on the sword is not firm enough, and the motions are not controlled or circular as described in the ideal steps. Additionally, there is a lack of emphasis on creating distinct patterns with the blade, which results in an unclear visual effect. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a firm grip, practicing controlled circular motions, and working on creating clear patterns to enhance the overall form of the knife flourish.
