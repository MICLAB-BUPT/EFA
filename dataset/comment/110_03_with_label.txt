The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a clear and fluid execution of the 'Pi Dao' (chopping action) with a focus on balance, control, and a smooth flow of motion. The transitions between the left and right chops are seamless, showcasing a strong grasp of form and technique. The movements are precise, and the character maintains a consistent rhythm throughout the sequence. These elements contribute to an effective and visually appealing demonstration of the chopping knife form.
