The bow stance punch action in this video is bad. The character does not execute the preparatory stance correctly, as the feet are not shoulder-width apart and the knees are not slightly bent. Additionally, the character does not maintain balance or control throughout the movement. To improve, the character should start in a natural stance with proper alignment of the feet and knees. They should also ensure that the body rotation and punch extension are fluid and controlled, with the focus on maintaining balance and power generation from the stance.
