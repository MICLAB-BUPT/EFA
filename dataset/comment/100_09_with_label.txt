The cloud hands action in this video is good. The practitioner maintains a neutral stance with relaxed, centered body and evenly distributed weight. They initiate a side-to-side movement by shifting their weight from one leg to the other, turning slightly as they do so. The hand movements are coordinated, circular, and flow seamlessly between the hands, passing each other without crossing directly. The practitioner's eyes follow the upper hand, ensuring focus and awareness throughout the sequence. The continuous, flowing, and coordinated movements are well executed, maintaining a sense of connection and flow.
