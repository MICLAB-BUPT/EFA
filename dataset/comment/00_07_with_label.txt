The pull up action in this video is good. The person starts with a dead hang, grips the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and initiates the pull by engaging their back and shoulder muscles. They pull until their chin is above the bar, maintaining a neutral head position throughout the movement, and then slowly lower back down to the starting dead hang position with full control. There are no significant deviations from the ideal standards provided.
