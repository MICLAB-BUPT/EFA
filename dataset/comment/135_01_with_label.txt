The downward staff chop action in this video is good. The person maintains a stable and balanced stance, which allows for power generation from the legs and core. They initiate the downward swing by extending the arm holding the nunchaku and rotating the body, generating momentum. The free handle of the nunchaku is brought down in a vertical or slightly diagonal arc, aiming for the intended target. The wrist is firm but not locked, allowing for a snapping motion at the point of impact. The follow-through after contact with the target helps maintain balance and control. There are no visible flaws in the execution of the movement.
