The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is bad. The character is not lying face up on a flat bench with feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. Instead, he is lying on his side, which can lead to improper form and increased risk of injury. Additionally, the character is not keeping his upper arms stationary throughout the exercise, which is essential for proper muscle engagement. Lastly, the character is not taking a breath and bracing the core, which can cause instability and poor control during the exercise. To improve, the character should lie face up on the bench, keep his upper arms stationary, and take a breath before starting the exercise.
