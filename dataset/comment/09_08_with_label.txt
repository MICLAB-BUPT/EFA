The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form by lying on an inclined bench, gripping the barbell with a full grip, and lowering the barbell to their chest. They also exhibit control during the upward push, keeping their elbows tucked in at a 45-75 degree angle. While there are no major flaws, refining their technique could involve adjusting the grip width for comfort and biomechanics, and ensuring a full range of motion while lowering the barbell to avoid potential injury or strain.
