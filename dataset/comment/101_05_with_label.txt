The left and right shuttle action in this video is good. The practitioner demonstrates a smooth transition between the two sides of the shuttle, maintaining balance and fluidity throughout the sequence. The stepping and turning motions are executed with precision, allowing for clear definition of the diagonal line of force. The ward-off and pushing movements are well-coordinated with the legwork, contributing to a cohesive and visually appealing performance. The alignment and form suggest that the practitioner has a solid understanding of Tai Chi principles and technique.
