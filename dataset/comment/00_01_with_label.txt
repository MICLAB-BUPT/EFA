The pull up action in this video is good. The individual starts from a dead hang with their arms fully extended and shoulders relaxed, which is an ideal starting position for performing pull-ups. They grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, ensuring a stable and controlled movement. The person engages their back and shoulder muscles throughout the exercise, pulling their elbows down towards their ribs rather than just using their arms. Finally, they complete the pull-up by lifting their chin above the bar before slowly lowering back down to the starting position. The controlled descent and full control during the exercise are also indicative of good form.
