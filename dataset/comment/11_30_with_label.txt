The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad because the individual does not follow the proper form. The person's elbows are not close to their torso, and they do not engage their core effectively. Additionally, the lifting phase is not controlled, which can lead to poor muscle activation and increased risk of injury. To improve, the individual should focus on keeping their elbows close to their body, engaging their core, and controlling the lifting phase to ensure proper muscle engagement and safety.
