The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The man maintains a straight back, engaged core, and chest-up posture throughout the exercise. He starts with the barbell resting in front of his thighs, keeping it close to his body as he pulls it up. His elbows lead the movement, moving out and up to the sides, and he reaches chest level or slightly below before slowly lowering the barbell back down. These actions ensure proper form and minimal stress on the shoulder joints, making the exercise effective and safe.
