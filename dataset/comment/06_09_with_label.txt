The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine, with her back straight and the bar close to her legs throughout the exercise. She bends her knees slightly while pushing her hips back, ensuring that she doesn't hyperextend at the top of the lift. The person's feet are hip-width apart, and she grips the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width, which helps maintain stability and control during the exercise. Additionally, she braces her core and engages her abdominal muscles, contributing to better posture and core strength. The person completes the lift by driving through her heels and extending her hips, demonstrating proper form and technique.
