The staff chop action in this video is bad. The character starts with a stable stance, but the execution of the downward strike is not executed with enough force and precision. The power generated from the ground through the legs and core is not effectively transferred to the staff, resulting in a weak downward motion. To improve this, the character should focus on generating more power from the ground up, using their legs and core muscles to drive the staff down with greater force and precision.
