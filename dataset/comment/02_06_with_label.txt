The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The individual starts with a proper grip on the barbell, standing with their feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. They maintain a straight back and neutral head position while bending at the hips to lower the torso towards the floor. As they pull the barbell up, they keep their elbows close to their body and focus on squeezing their shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. Finally, they control the descent by slowly lowering the barbell back to the starting position without using momentum or rounding the back. These actions ensure a well-executed and controlled barbell bent-over row exercise.
