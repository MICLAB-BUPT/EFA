The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is bad. The person starts by lying on the bench with a dumbbell in one hand, which is not ideal as they should be holding two dumbbells and keeping their upper arms stationary throughout the exercise. They also start from an extended arm position, which might not provide enough resistance for effective muscle engagement. To improve, the person should lie face up on the bench with feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other, and extend the arms straight up above the chest to avoid locking them out.
