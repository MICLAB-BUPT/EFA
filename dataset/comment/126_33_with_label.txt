The staff chop action in this video is bad. The character begins with an unstable stance, not providing a solid foundation for the downward strike. The grip on the Nangun is not firm enough, and the positioning of the staff is not optimal for a powerful downward motion. Additionally, the body does not coil slightly to store potential energy, which would help generate more power during the strike. These deviations make the action less effective and controlled compared to the ideal form.
