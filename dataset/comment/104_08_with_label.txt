The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The character maintains a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ), with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. Knees are deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground, back straight, and core engaged, providing stability and power. The initial hand positioning is also well-executed, with one hand performing the 'Lou Shou' ( lou shou , scooping/raking hand) and the other hand in a guard position. The sweeping motion of the 'Lou Shou' is fluid and controlled, with the palm open and using the power generated from the 'Ma Bu' and the rotation of the waist. Overall, the character demonstrates excellent form and technique throughout the movement.
