The sword chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the sword firmly with a relaxed grip. They prepare for the 'Pi' (downward chopping or splitting) action by raising the sword above their head, positioning it for a downward cut. The character then initiates the 'Pi Jian' (downward cutting motion), using power from the ground through the legs and core to execute a clean cut. The wrist and forearm control the blade's angle, ensuring precision. The character completes the 'Pi' by bringing the sword to a lower position near the waist or thigh. The finishing position depends on the style and intended application, showcasing skillful execution of the form.
