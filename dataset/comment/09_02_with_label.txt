The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person lies on an inclined bench with their feet flat on the floor, and their eyes are directly under the barbell when it's racked. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart using a full grip. The person unracks the barbell with arms extended, keeping wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked. They lower the barbell under control to the upper chest while maintaining a slight bend in the elbows. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top.
