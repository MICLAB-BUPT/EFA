The bow stance head wrap action in this video is good. The character transitions from a preparatory stance to a 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with one leg stepping forward and the other leg remaining straight. Simultaneously, the character initiates the 'Chan Tou' (head-wrapping action) with the Dao, executing a circular motion around the head without making contact. The movements are controlled and fluid, demonstrating proper technique for this part of the form.
