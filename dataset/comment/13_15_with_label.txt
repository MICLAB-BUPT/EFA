The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual lies face up on the bench with feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other, and extends their arms straight up above the chest, keeping a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. The upper arms are kept stationary throughout the exercise, with only the elbow joints moving. The person takes a breath and braces the core, maintaining a stable torso on the bench. They lower the dumbbells towards the forehead (or slightly behind the head for a greater stretch) by bending the elbows, then extend the arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps. The individual focuses on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement, exhales during the upward push, and avoids locking out the elbows.
