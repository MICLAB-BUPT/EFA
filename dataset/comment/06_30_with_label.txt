The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is bad. The person starts with their back arched and the barbell positioned at a height that is too high for proper form. This can lead to unnecessary strain on the lower back, and may increase the risk of injury. To improve, they should start with the barbell positioned closer to their shins, and maintain a straight back throughout the exercise. Additionally, they should focus on keeping their core engaged and their glutes squeezed to maintain proper posture and control during the lift.
