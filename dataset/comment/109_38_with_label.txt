The knife flourish action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a firm yet relaxed grip on the sword, and their movements are not controlled or fluid. The stance appears to be unstable, and the motion of the sword is erratic, which suggests a lack of focus and precision. To improve, the individual should practice proper grip techniques, work on maintaining balance, and concentrate on creating clear patterns with the blade.
