The left and right chopping knife action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid or controlled, which is a deviation from the ideal form. The transitions between the two chops are abrupt and lack precision, which can make it difficult to maintain balance and control throughout the sequence. To improve, the character should focus on practicing smooth, continuous motions with proper footwork and body rotation, ensuring that each chop is executed with power and grace while maintaining a balanced stance.
