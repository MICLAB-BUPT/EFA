The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The practitioner starts with a stable stance, holding the sword naturally and maintaining a centered and balanced posture. They initiate the upward movement from the wrist and forearm, guiding the sword in a smooth, arcing path, and keeping the blade's edge facing the direction of the arc. The power comes from the waist rotation, and the practitioner completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position where it can continue into another technique or return to a guard position. The wrist remains flexible, ready for the transition. Overall, the performance showcases good form and technique.
