The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The person starts in a preparatory stance, holding the knife firmly but with a relaxed grip. They then initiate the 'Pi Dao' (chopping action) on one side, raising the knife in an arc and bringing it down in a chopping motion, utilizing the weight of the blade and the body's rotation. After completing the chop on one side, they transition to the other side, maintaining balance and control throughout the sequence. The person alternates between the left and right 'Pi Dao', creating a continuous sequence of chopping movements, demonstrating a smooth flow of motion.
