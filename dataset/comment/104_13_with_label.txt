The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The character begins with a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ), with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and knees deeply bent, which provides stability and power for the movement. The hand positioning is also appropriate, with one hand performing the 'Lou Shou' ( lou shou , scooping/raking hand) while the other is in a guard position or chambered at the waist. The 'Lou Shou' movement is executed with a sweeping, scooping, or raking motion of the hand, using the power generated from the 'Ma Bu' and the rotation of the waist. The arm is relaxed but firm, and the movement is controlled and fluid. Overall, the character maintains proper form and technique throughout the exercise.
