The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The person approaches the barbell with their feet hip-width apart, positioning them over the mid-foot. They also maintain a neutral spine by engaging their core and pulling their shoulder blades down and back. The person takes a deep breath and braces the core before initiating the lift, driving through the heels and extending the legs and hips simultaneously while keeping the bar close to the body. Finally, they continue extending until standing upright with the hips and knees fully locked out, maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core.
