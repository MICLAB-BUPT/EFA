The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains a stable base by lying face-up on the bench with feet flat on the floor. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip which ensures consistent grip width for each repetition and set. The unracking of the barbell is done carefully with straight arms, positioning it directly over their chest with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle to their body. The descent towards the chest is controlled, and the individual touches the barbell to their lower chest before pushing it back up to the starting position with a steady pressing motion.
