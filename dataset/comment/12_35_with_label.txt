The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is bad because the individual is not following the recommended steps for proper form. They are standing with feet wider than shoulder-width apart, which can lead to instability and increased risk of injury. The elbows are locked out at the top of the movement, which may cause strain on the shoulders and other joints. The chest is slouched, indicating poor posture, and there's a lack of engagement in the core muscles. To improve, the individual should stand with their feet shoulder-width apart, keep the elbows slightly bent throughout the exercise, maintain an upright posture with a focus on engaging the core, and ensure that the lateral raise is controlled and initiated from the shoulders while lifting with the medial deltoids.
