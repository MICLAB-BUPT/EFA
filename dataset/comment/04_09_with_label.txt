The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The individual approaches the barbell with a proper stance, grips it firmly, and maintains a neutral spine throughout the lift. He drives through his heels to initiate the lift, keeping the bar close to his body as he extends his legs and hips simultaneously. He also maintains tension throughout the movement and lowers the bar under control by reversing the motion. Overall, the technique demonstrates good form and control during the exercise.
