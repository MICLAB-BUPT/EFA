The staff point action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance with a firm grip on the staff, ensuring proper control and precision throughout the movement. The thrusting motion is quick and precise, demonstrating the technique's effectiveness. The body remains balanced and supported, minimizing unnecessary extension or telegraphing of the strike. The retraction of the staff after the point is also swift and controlled, maintaining the flow of the technique. Overall, the character's performance aligns well with the ideal steps for executing a 'Dian Gun' staff point.
