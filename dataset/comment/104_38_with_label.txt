The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character's feet are not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, which is an essential aspect of maintaining stability and balance during martial arts practice. Additionally, the knees are not deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground, deviating from the ideal form that provides stability and power for the technique. To improve, the character should adjust their stance by widening their feet and bending their knees more deeply while keeping their back straight and core engaged.
