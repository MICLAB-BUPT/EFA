The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The man stands with his feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing the body, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise. He keeps his core engaged and maintains an upright posture with the chest up and shoulders back, avoiding slouching or leaning forward. The movement is controlled as he raises the arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. He slowly lowers the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control and resisting the urge to drop them. These aspects align with the ideal steps for performing a proper dumbbell lateral raise.
