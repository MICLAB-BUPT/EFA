The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not wide enough, with the feet being closer to shoulder-width apart than ideal. This can reduce stability and power generation during movements. Additionally, the character's knees are not deeply bent or parallel to the ground, which can affect balance and effectiveness of techniques. To improve, the character should widen their stance, deepen their knee bends, and ensure their back remains straight while maintaining core engagement.
