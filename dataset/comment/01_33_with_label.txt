The barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The movement being performed is actually a Barbell Skull Crusher (triceps extension), not a traditional bench press, which fundamentally invalidates the initial assessment's focus on feet placement and bench angle for chest pressing. However, judging the Skull Crusher form, the primary flaw is the severe, uncontrolled flaring of the elbows outward during the eccentric (lowering) phase. This excessive outward rotation places high shear stress on the elbow joint and significantly compromises the isolation of the triceps muscle. To execute the Skull Crusher correctly, the athlete must strictly maintain the elbows tucked and pointing straight toward the ceiling throughout the entire range of motion. The bar should be lowered in a controlled, slow manner toward the top of the head/forehead, and the movement should be driven solely by the extension of the elbow joint.
