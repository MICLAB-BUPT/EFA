The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The individual maintains a firm grip on the barbell with hands slightly wider than hip-width, ensuring proper balance and reducing strain on the lower back. The elbows are kept close to the torso throughout the movement, which is crucial for effective bicep engagement and minimizing unnecessary motion. Additionally, the individual takes a breath and braces their core, demonstrating an awareness of proper form and stability. The focus on squeezing the biceps at the top of the movement indicates a strong understanding of the exercise's target muscles. Finally, the controlled lowering of the barbell ensures that the entire range of motion is utilized, contributing to the effectiveness of the exercise.
