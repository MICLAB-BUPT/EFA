The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits a moderate degree of full-body momentum, using a slight hip thrust and backward lean ("cheating") to initiate the concentric phase, particularly visible as the torso rocks backward. This momentum decreases the targeted isolation of the biceps. Furthermore, the athlete allows the elbows to drift forward from the sides of the torso during the curl, reducing the peak tension on the biceps by shortening the lever arm. The wrists also appear to be slightly extended ("breaking") at the top, potentially straining the wrist joints. To correct this, the athlete must maintain a completely fixed torso and hips, keeping the upper arms pinned against the sides of the body. The wrists should be kept neutral, and the weight should be reduced if necessary to ensure strict, isolated bicep contraction throughout the entire repetition.
