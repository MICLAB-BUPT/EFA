The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The character starts by swinging the sword in a circular motion, which deviates from the ideal step of initiating the 'Chan Tou' with a controlled and fluid movement. Additionally, the character's posture is not fully engaged, as they are standing upright rather than maintaining the 'Gong Bu' stance with one leg forward and the other back. To improve, the character should start with a neutral stance, then transition into the 'Gong Bu' while simultaneously initiating the 'Chan Tou' with the sword in a controlled manner.
