The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The woman maintains a neutral spine and engages her core throughout the movement, which is crucial for maintaining proper form and reducing the risk of injury. Her feet are positioned hip-width apart with the bar over the mid-foot, providing stability and balance. She grips the bar just outside the legs with an overhand grip, ensuring a secure hold. Her posture and alignment suggest she is experienced in performing the exercise correctly. However, there's room for improvement in terms of pushing through the heels more effectively during the lift and keeping the bar close to the body for better control. By refining these aspects, she can further enhance her performance and ensure even greater results.
