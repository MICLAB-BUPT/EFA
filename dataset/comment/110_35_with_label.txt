The left and right chopping knife action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not smooth or controlled, and the footwork and transitions between chops are not well executed. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining balance, controlling the movement with the weight of the blade and body rotation, and performing a continuous sequence of chopping motions with proper form.
