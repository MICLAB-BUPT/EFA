The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual starts by lying face up on a flat bench with feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. They extend their arms straight up above the chest, maintaining a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. Throughout the exercise, they keep the upper arms stationary and only move at the elbow joint. They take a breath and brace the core while keeping a stable torso on the bench, avoiding excessive arching of the lower back. The individual slowly lowers the dumbbells towards the forehead or slightly behind the head for a greater stretch, maintaining control and keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the floor. Finally, they extend their arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement. This sequence closely follows the ideal action steps for laying dumbbell triceps extension, making it an effective and well-executed exercise.
