The sword sweep action in this video is good. The practitioner maintains a stable stance and initiates the sweeping motion from the waist and hips, rotating the body in the direction of the sweep. The arm holding the sword extends outward with the blade relatively horizontal and close to the ground, maintaining a consistent blade angle throughout the sweep. The stepping motion is smooth and controlled, contributing to the reach and power of the sweep. Finally, the practitioner completes the sweep with a controlled stop, maintaining balance and stability.
