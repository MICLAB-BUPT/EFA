The barbell deadlift action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits a significant premature hip extension (hips rising faster than the shoulders) at the initiation of the pull. This flawed kinematic sequence causes the lifter to shift from a proper leg-dominant start position to a stiff-legged deadlift mid-way through the ascent, compromising posterior chain efficiency and placing excessive stress on the lower back. Additionally, the athlete pulls the barbell forward slightly off the mid-foot, increasing the required moment arm on the spine. The eccentric (lowering) phase is also uncontrolled and involves dropping the weight. To improve, the athlete must focus on lifting the bar by pushing the floor away, ensuring the shoulders and hips rise simultaneously and maintaining a consistent back angle relative to the floor until the bar passes the knees.
