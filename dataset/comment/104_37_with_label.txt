The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character starts with an improper stance, as the feet are not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and the toes are not pointing forward or slightly outward. Additionally, the knees are not deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground (or as close as possible). These deviations from the ideal stance can affect the stability and power of the movement, making it less effective for the intended application. To improve, the character should adjust their stance to meet the ideal standards provided, ensuring proper form and execution of the technique.
