The staff lift action in this video is bad. The character starts with a balanced stance, but the grip on the staff is not ideal, as it is closer to the middle rather than one end. This could affect the stability and control during the lift. Additionally, the character's body position does not seem to be optimal for generating upward force, which might lead to an ineffective lift. To improve, the character should ensure the grip is closer to one end of the staff and maintain a more dynamic body position that involves bending the knees and using the legs and hips to drive the lift.
