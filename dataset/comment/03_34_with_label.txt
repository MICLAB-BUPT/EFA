The barbell upright row action in this video is bad. The woman starts with a poor grip, as the barbell is too close to her body, which can lead to excessive strain on the shoulders and lower back. Her elbows are also not high enough compared to her wrists, which might cause improper shoulder engagement. To improve, she should start with a wider grip and ensure her elbows are higher than her wrists throughout the exercise.
