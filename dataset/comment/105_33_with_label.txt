The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is bad. The character starts with a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ), but the stance is not wide enough, and the feet are not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart. The knees are deeply bent, but the thighs are not parallel to the ground. The hands are positioned at the waist, forming fists, ready for the downward chopping strikes. However, the character initiates the 'Shuang Pi Quan' ( shuang pi quan ) by bringing both fists down forcefully towards an imaginary target, but the power is not generated from the 'Ma Bu,' the core, and the downward movement of the arms. The elbows are slightly bent at the point of impact, and the fists are angled slightly inwards or downwards. After the strikes, the character does not retract the fists back to a guard position or chambered position, and the 'Ma Bu' is not maintained throughout the entire movement, providing stability and power. To improve, the character should widen the stance, bend the knees more deeply, and ensure that the power is generated from the core and the downward movement of the arms. The character should also maintain the 'Ma Bu' throughout the entire movement and retract the fists back to a guard position or chambered position after the strikes.
