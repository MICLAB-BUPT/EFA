The elbow whip action in this video is bad. The person's form and technique are not ideal, as they lack proper control and fluidity in their movements. Their body posture is also slightly hunched, which can lead to strain on the back and neck over time. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a stable stance with good posture, using their elbow effectively as a pivot point, and practicing smooth, controlled movements to ensure proper technique and minimize injury risk.
