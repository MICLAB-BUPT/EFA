The cross drape red action in this video is good. The person demonstrates proper technique by maintaining a secure grip on the rope, initiating the cross pattern with controlled movements, and smoothly transitioning between vertical and horizontal swings. They exhibit fluidity and precision in their movements, keeping the rope taut throughout the sequence. While the performance is already satisfactory, further refinement could involve more dynamic variations in the cross pattern or incorporating additional elements to enhance the visual appeal and complexity of the routine.
