The staff throw action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a firm grip on the staff, initiating the throw with core rotation, and extending the arms outward to guide the force. The release of the staff at the precise moment is also well-executed, and the follow-through ensures balance and injury prevention. These elements contribute to a well-formed staff throw technique.
