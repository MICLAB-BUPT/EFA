The sword thrust action in this video is good. The character begins in a balanced stance, with the sword held firmly and aligned with the target. They extend their arm forward smoothly and powerfully, creating a unified movement that involves both the arm and body. The tip of the sword makes contact with the target, and the character maintains balance and control throughout the thrust. This execution demonstrates proper technique and precision, resulting in an effective and well-formed sword thrust.
