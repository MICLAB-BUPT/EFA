The staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the Nangun with a firm grip and positioning it for a downward strike. The body coiled slightly, storing potential energy before executing the 'Pi Gun,' a powerful downward striking motion. The movement is executed with force and precision, driving the Nangun downwards through the legs, core, and arms. The non-wielding hand moves for balance, contributing to the downward momentum. The finishing position near the waist or thigh is consistent with the intended style and application of the technique.
