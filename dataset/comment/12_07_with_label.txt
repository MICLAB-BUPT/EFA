The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The woman maintains a slight bend in her elbows throughout the exercise, which helps to avoid locking them out and reduces the risk of injury. Her posture is upright with the chest up and shoulders back, preventing slouching or leaning forward that could compromise the effectiveness of the exercise. The arms are raised parallel to the floor, demonstrating control and proper technique. The movement is initiated from the shoulders, as she focuses on lifting with the medial deltoids, emphasizing the correct muscle group engagement. Finally, she lowers the dumbbells slowly while maintaining control, ensuring the eccentric phase is performed correctly for optimal muscle growth and strength development.
