The spinning whip action in this video is bad. The character fails to start with a stable stance, holding the whip handle firmly and extending the chain. Instead, they initiate the turning of the body before swinging the whip, which is not ideal for generating momentum. Additionally, the swing lacks control and precision, as the whip does not follow a clear trajectory. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining balance and control throughout the entire sequence, starting with a proper stance and ensuring that the whip's movement is smooth and controlled.
