The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual starts by lying on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. They then extend their arms straight up above the chest, keeping a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. The person maintains a stable torso on the bench while slowly lowering the dumbbells towards the forehead (or slightly behind the head for a greater stretch) by bending the elbows. Finally, they extend their arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement. The individual's form and technique are consistent with the ideal steps provided, ensuring proper execution of the exercise.
