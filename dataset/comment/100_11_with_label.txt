The cloud hands action in this video is good. The person maintains a relaxed and centered posture, with knees slightly bent, while performing the side-to-side movements. The weight shift from one leg to the other is gradual and continuous, following the ideal steps of Tai Chi practice. The hands move in a coordinated, circular motion, passing each other without crossing directly, as described in the ideal actions. The person's focus remains on the upper hand, maintaining balance and awareness throughout the sequence. The repetition of the 'Yun Shou' (Cloud Hands) movement is consistent with the ideal standards, showcasing the individual's proficiency in Tai Chi technique.
