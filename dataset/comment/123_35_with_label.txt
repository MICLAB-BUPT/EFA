The back flourish action in this video is bad because the person's movement is not fluid and continuous. The non-wielding hand does not move in a coordinated manner for balance, which can lead to instability and loss of control over the sword. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a steady grip with both hands, using coordinated wrist, elbow, and shoulder movements to execute the circular or figure-eight motion behind their back smoothly and continuously.
