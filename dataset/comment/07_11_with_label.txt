The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The woman starts with the barbell resting across her upper back, maintaining a neutral spine and keeping her chest up. She initiates the squat by simultaneously bending at the hips and knees, demonstrating proper form throughout the descent. The woman then drives through her heels to return to the starting position, keeping a consistent back angle and bracing her core. Her stance width allows for deep squats while maintaining balance, ensuring stability during the exercise. Overall, the execution of the back squat in the video aligns well with the ideal standards provided, showcasing a strong foundation for further improvements in technique.
