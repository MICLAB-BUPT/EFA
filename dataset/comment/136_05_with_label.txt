The sword thrust action in this video is good. The practitioner begins in a balanced stance, which allows for stability and forward lunging. They initiate the thrust with a smooth and controlled extension of their arm, keeping the blade aligned with the target. Simultaneously, they step forward with the front leg, adding power and reach to the thrust. The alignment from the back heel through the hips and shoulders to the tip of the sword is maintained, maximizing power and accuracy. The practitioner completes the thrust with full extension of the arm and body, maintaining balance and control.
