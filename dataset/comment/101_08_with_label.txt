The left and right shuttle action in this video is good. The character begins by shifting their weight onto one leg, preparing to step, and then performs a ward-off and pushing motion with their arms. The body turns towards the stepping leg as they step diagonally forward and outward, establishing a bow stance. The character's forward arm is in a ward-off position while the other arm is extended forward in a pushing position, creating a diagonal line of force. The character then repeats the movement on the opposite side, shifting weight, stepping diagonally with the other leg, and performing the ward-off and push with the opposite arms. This alternating movement from side to side is the 'Zuo You' (left-right) aspect of 'Chuan Suo' (shuttle).
