The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form throughout the exercise, starting with a wide grip on the barbell and lying on an inclined bench at a suitable angle. They also keep their elbows tucked in while lowering the barbell to their chest, ensuring a controlled descent. Furthermore, they push the barbell back up to the starting position with a slight bend in the elbows, maintaining core engagement throughout the movement. These aspects of technique contribute to effective and safe execution of the exercise, minimizing the risk of injury and optimizing muscle engagement.
