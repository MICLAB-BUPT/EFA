The rope slide action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid or controlled, and the grip on the rope appears to be too tight, which could lead to difficulty in performing the desired techniques. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a secure but relaxed grip, allowing for smooth and controlled movements of the rope. Additionally, practicing the 'Liu Sheng' with varying speeds and complexities can help refine their technique and ensure proper form.
