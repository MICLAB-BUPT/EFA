The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine and keeps the chest up throughout the movement, which helps prevent injury and ensures proper form. The stance width is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, providing stability during the squat. The person also drives through the heels during the ascent, which is crucial for maintaining balance and power. The core is braced, adding to the stability and control of the exercise. However, there is room for improvement as the person could further deepen the squat to achieve parallel or a greater depth for more effective muscle engagement.
