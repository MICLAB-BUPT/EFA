The sword thrust action in this video is good. The individual begins in a balanced stance with the sword held firmly, which allows for a smooth and controlled extension of the arm. The step forward with the front leg is well-coordinated with the arm movement, adding power to the thrust. The alignment from the back heel through the hips and shoulders to the tip of the sword is maintained throughout the motion. The completion of the thrust with full extension of the arm and body showcases control and balance. Overall, the execution of these steps results in an effective and precise sword thrust.
