The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The person demonstrates a proper setup with their feet hip-width apart and the barbell positioned over mid-foot. They maintain a slight bend in the knees and hips while keeping their back straight, which is crucial for avoiding injury. The individual also takes a deep breath and braces their core, engaging their abdominal muscles and lats. The movement is fluid, with the person lowering the bar as far as flexibility allows without rounding the spine or touching the ground. Finally, they drive through their heels to stand up fully at the top of the lift, maintaining a neutral spine throughout.
