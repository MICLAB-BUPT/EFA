The spear crush action in this video is bad. The character fails to initiate the movement with a stable stance, as the grip on the spear is not firm enough and the body positioning is not optimal for generating power. The front leg does not move forward with enough momentum, and the rear arm extension is not sufficient to drive the spearhead towards the target. The front hand does not provide adequate control or stability, resulting in a wobbly spear. Lastly, the character does not maintain balance and control after completing the thrust, which compromises the overall effectiveness of the technique.
