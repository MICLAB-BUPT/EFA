The sword point action in this video is bad. The character does not initiate a small, controlled step or shift in body weight towards the target before making contact with the tip of the sword. Instead, the character makes contact with the target without preparing for it. To improve, the character should focus on initiating a subtle and quick movement towards the target before striking with the sword tip to ensure precision and accuracy.
