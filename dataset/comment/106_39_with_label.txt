The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The person starts by holding the sword with both hands and raising it above their head, which is not the correct way to start a bow stance head wrap. The ideal starting position should be with one hand holding the sword close to the body and the other hand resting on the head. Additionally, the person's movements are too abrupt and jerky, lacking fluidity and control. A proper bow stance head wrap should be smooth and controlled, with the sword moving in a circular motion around the head.
