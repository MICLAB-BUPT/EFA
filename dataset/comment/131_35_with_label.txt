The spear twist action in this video is bad. The character's grip on the spear is not firm enough, and the contact point with the opponent's weapon is not close to their hands. Additionally, the twisting motion lacks the necessary wrist, arm, and body rotation, making it difficult to control or disarm the opponent effectively. To improve, the character should ensure a firm but adaptable grip, aim for a contact point closer to their hands, and apply constant pressure and control during the twisting motion.
