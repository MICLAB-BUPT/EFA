The spear twist action in this video is bad. The person's grip on the spear is not firm enough, and they do not maintain constant pressure during the twisting motion. This lack of control can lead to an ineffective disarm or transition into another technique. To improve, the person should work on developing a stronger grip and maintaining smooth, deliberate force throughout the twist. Additionally, practicing more precise control and balance will help ensure that the spear twist is executed correctly and safely.
