The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character's feet are not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, and the toes are pointing forward instead of slightly outward. The knees are not deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground (or as close as possible). The back is not straight, and the core is not engaged. Additionally, the hands are positioned incorrectly, with one hand performing a 'Lou Shou' motion but without the correct starting position or trajectory. To improve, the character should adjust their stance to have wider, more angled feet, ensure proper knee bending and thigh alignment, straighten their back, engage their core, and correctly position their hands for the 'Lou Shou' motion.
