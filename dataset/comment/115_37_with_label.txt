The staff flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and controlled, which is a key aspect of proper staff handling. The stance appears to be stiff and rigid, which may affect the overall performance of the technique. Additionally, there seems to be a lack of precision in the circular motions, resulting in less defined patterns. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a relaxed yet firm grip, incorporating more fluid body movements, and practicing the techniques with greater control and precision.
