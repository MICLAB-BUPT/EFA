The sword chop action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and controlled, which is a key aspect of proper sword chop form. The execution lacks the power and precision required for an effective cut. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, raising the sword with intention, and transferring power through the entire body to ensure a clean and powerful downward chop.
