The nunchaku flourish action in this video is bad because the person is not maintaining a firm grip on one handle of the nunchaku, which leads to less control over the movements. The free handle is swinging freely without proper guidance, resulting in an uncontrolled motion. Additionally, there are no clear transitions between different planes of motion or body movements that complement the nunchaku movements, making the performance appear disjointed. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a firm grip and using controlled wrist, arm, and shoulder rotations to create a flowing and continuous motion with the nunchaku.
