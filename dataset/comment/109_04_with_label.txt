The knife flourish action in this video is good. The character maintains a firm yet relaxed grip on the broadsword, showcasing control and precision throughout the performance. The movements are fluid and continuous, creating clear visual patterns that demonstrate skill and technique. Additionally, the non-wielding hand is coordinated with the movements of the broadsword, enhancing balance and adding to the overall aesthetic appeal of the knife flourish. This well-executed action reflects a high level of proficiency in martial arts and knife handling.
