The cloud hands action in this video is good. The performer maintains a balanced stance with knees slightly bent and the body centered, which is crucial for Tai Chi movements. They shift their weight from one leg to the other smoothly and maintain a continuous flow of motion. The hands move in a coordinated, circular motion, as if waving clouds, without crossing directly, demonstrating good form and precision. The eyes follow the upper hand, indicating focus and awareness. Overall, the performer executes the 'Yun Shou' (Cloud Hands) movement with fluidity and grace, adhering to the ideal standards for Tai Chi practice.
