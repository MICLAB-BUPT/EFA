The sword chop action in this video is good. The person maintains a stable stance, raises the sword above their head with proper grip, and executes a powerful downward cutting motion. The movement is fluid, with the wrist and forearm controlling the blade's angle to ensure a clean cut. Additionally, the non-wielding hand assists in generating power during the swing. The transition to the next movement appears smooth, indicating a well-practiced technique.
