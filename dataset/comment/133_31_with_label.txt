The spear flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, and the spear does not move with precision and grace. There are abrupt changes in direction and speed, which detract from the visual appeal of the performance. To improve, the character should work on maintaining a balanced stance, using their entire body to create circular patterns, and incorporating smooth transitions between movements.
