The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The lifter starts with the barbell racked on their shoulders, ensuring that their elbows are slightly bent and the wrists are straight. They maintain a full grip on the bar and engage their core before pushing the barbell upwards. The lifter's form is controlled throughout the exercise, with the barbell being lowered to chest level and then pressed back up. The movement is smooth, demonstrating proper technique for an effective bench press.
