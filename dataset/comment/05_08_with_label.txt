The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person starts by lying face up on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart, positioning the barbell across the hips. They place their hands on the barbell to stabilize it, keeping their arms relatively straight but not locked out. The person then takes a deep breath and braces the core, engaging the abdominal muscles. Finally, they drive through the heels, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees.
