The staff throw action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a strong foundation with feet shoulder-width apart and maintains a firm grip on the staff. The core rotation is executed effectively, leading to a powerful release of the staff towards the ground. The follow-through after releasing the staff showcases proper technique and balance. Overall, the actions align well with the ideal standards for a successful staff throw.
