The spinning whip action in this video is good. The person starts in a stable stance, holding the handle of the Jiujiebian firmly with one hand. They initiate the turn of the body, rotating their torso while swinging the whip. The person maintains control over the whip's trajectory and uses their wrist and forearm to guide it. The non-wielding hand assists in controlling the whip's movement throughout the entire sequence.
