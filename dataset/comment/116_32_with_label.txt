The sword stir action in this video is bad. The character begins with an incorrect stance, holding the sword with both hands and not maintaining a firm grip. The execution of the upward cutting motion lacks power and control, and the wrist and forearm are not engaged properly. To improve, the character should start with a stable stance, hold the sword correctly, and focus on generating power through the legs and core while controlling the movement with the wrist and forearm.
