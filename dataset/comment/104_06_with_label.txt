The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The character maintains a solid and wide stance with the knees deeply bent, which provides stability and power. The hand positioning is precise, with one hand performing the 'Lou Shou' movement, showcasing control and fluidity. The trajectory of the 'Lou Shou' is well-executed, moving in a circular path and using the rotation of the waist for generating power. Additionally, the character's core is engaged throughout the movement, enhancing balance and effectiveness. These aspects contribute to a well-performed horse stance gather hand technique.
