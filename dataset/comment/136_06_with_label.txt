The sword thrust action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a smooth and controlled motion, starting from a balanced stance with the sword held firmly. The extension of the arm is executed with precision, maintaining a straight line from the back heel to the tip of the sword. The simultaneous forward step adds power and reach to the thrust, indicating coordination between the upper and lower body movements. The completion of the thrust with full extension of the arm and body shows control and balance. These aspects of the sword thrust make it an effective and refined technique.
