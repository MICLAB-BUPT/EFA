They initiate the wrist flower technique by rotating their wrist, causing the sword to move in a circular pattern. The movement appears fluid and continuous, creating a visually appealing 'flower' pattern. The practitioner's non-wielding hand moves in a coordinated manner for balance, demonstrating control of the blade and clear, distinct patterns. The action is executed with precision and refinement, showcasing good form and technique.
