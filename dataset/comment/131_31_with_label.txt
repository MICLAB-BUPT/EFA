The spear twist action in this video is bad. The person does not maintain a stable stance and the grip on the spear is not firm but adaptable, which can compromise control during the twisting motion. The contact point with the opponent's weapon is closer to the spearhead, which could lead to a less effective twisting action. The wrist, arm, and body rotation are not executed smoothly, resulting in sudden jerks that might affect balance and control. Lastly, the pressure and control during the twisting motion are not constant, which can make it difficult to disarm or control the opponent's weapon effectively. To improve, the person should maintain a stable stance, use the shaft of the spear for contact, apply smooth and deliberate force, and ensure constant pressure and control throughout the twisting motion.
