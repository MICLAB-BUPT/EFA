The cross drape red action in this video is good. The character demonstrates a secure grip on the Liuxingchui ( meteor hammer) and initiates the 'Shi Zi' ( shi zi , cross) pattern with a controlled and precise swing. The vertical component of the cross is executed smoothly, with the wrist, forearm, and body movement effectively controlling the trajectory and momentum of the hammer. The horizontal component of the cross is also performed with fluidity, maintaining the rope's tension throughout. The 'Pi Hong' ( pi hong , draping a red cloth) aspect adds an artistic touch to the technique, enhancing the overall flow and elegance of the performance.
