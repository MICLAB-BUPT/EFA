The barbell glute bridge action in this video is bad. The athlete commits a significant error by initiating the movement without achieving a posterior pelvic tilt, leading to poor glute isolation and excessive lumbar hyperextension at the top of the lift, visible as a pronounced arch in the lower back. This posture transfers tension to the lumbar spine instead of maximizing glute contraction, which is the primary goal of the exercise. The feet are also positioned slightly too far away from the hips, reducing the mechanical advantage for the glutes. To correct this, the athlete must focus on tilting the pelvis posteriorly (tucking the tailbone) and bracing the core prior to lifting. The movement should stop when the body forms a straight, neutral line from the shoulders to the knees, ensuring the tension is felt exclusively in the glutes, not the lower back.
