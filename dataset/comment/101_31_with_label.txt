The left and right shuttle action in this video is bad. The character starts with a forward lunge, which is not a proper starting position for the Tai Chi form. They then shift their weight onto one leg but do not establish a bow stance as described. Instead of performing a ward-off and pushing motion with their arms, they move their arms in a sweeping motion without a clear target or focus. Lastly, they repeat the movement on the opposite side without maintaining the correct posture and alignment. To improve, the character should start from a relaxed, centered position, properly establish a bow stance, perform the ward-off and push with clear intention, and maintain consistent form throughout the sequence.
