The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual lies on a decline bench with their feet secured under the pads, which is appropriate for this exercise. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and maintain a full grip, ensuring stability and control during the movement. The unracking of the barbell with arms extended, maintaining a straight wrist and slightly unlocked elbows, is also correct. Furthermore, they lower the barbell under control to the lower chest area, demonstrating proper form by keeping the elbows tucked in and maintaining a roughly 45-degree angle to the body. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms while exhaling forcefully, which is crucial for maintaining core engagement throughout the exercise.
