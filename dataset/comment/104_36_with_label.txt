The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character's feet are not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, and the toes are not pointing forward or slightly outward. This indicates that the 'Ma Bu' (horse stance) is not properly executed, which could affect balance and stability during the movement. To improve, the character should ensure that their feet are positioned correctly with toes pointing forward or slightly outward to maintain proper balance and power during the technique.
