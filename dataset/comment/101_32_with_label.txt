The left and right shuttle action in this video is bad. The person starts from a standing position, which is not ideal as it lacks the necessary preparation and centering required for Tai Chi movements. They begin by stepping diagonally forward with one leg, but the movement appears stiff and not fluid. The arms are also not positioned correctly for ward-off and pushing motions, which are essential in Tai Chi. Furthermore, the person's body does not turn towards the stepping leg properly, resulting in an imbalance and an unnatural posture. To improve, the individual should start in a more centered stance, focus on fluid and controlled movements, and ensure that their arms are correctly positioned during each step to maintain proper form.
