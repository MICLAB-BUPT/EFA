The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The man maintains a straight back and a neutral head position throughout the exercise, which is crucial for proper form and minimizing the risk of injury. His feet are shoulder-width apart, and his knees are slightly bent, providing stability during the movement. The barbell is held with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width, ensuring a secure and balanced lift. As he pulls the barbell up towards his lower chest or upper abdomen, his elbows remain close to his body, emphasizing proper technique and muscle engagement. Finally, he lowers the barbell back to the starting position slowly and under control, maintaining focus on squeezing his shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. These aspects contribute to the overall effectiveness and safety of the exercise, making it a good demonstration of the barbell bent-over row.
