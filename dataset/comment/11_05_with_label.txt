The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The individual maintains a steady grip on the barbell and lifts it towards his shoulders with controlled movement, keeping his elbows close to his body. The focus is on squeezing the biceps at the top of the movement. The individual demonstrates proper form by engaging his core and maintaining control throughout the exercise. These actions contribute to effective muscle engagement and reduced risk of injury.
