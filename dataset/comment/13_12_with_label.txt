The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is bad. The athlete is performing the exercise with an excessive range of motion at the shoulder joint, allowing the upper arms to drift significantly backward (towards the head) during the eccentric phase. This compromises triceps isolation by introducing shoulder flexion, converting the movement partly into a pullover, and making the triceps work less efficient. The athlete also fails to fully extend the elbows at the top of the concentric phase, limiting the peak contraction of the triceps. To correct this, the athlete must strictly maintain the upper arms perpendicular to the floor throughout the entire movement, keeping the shoulder joint fixed. They should focus on a full elbow extension at the top and a controlled descent, bending only at the elbow joint to maximize triceps recruitment.
