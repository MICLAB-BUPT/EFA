The left and right chopping knife action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a relaxed grip on the sword, which is an essential aspect of proper form. The individual also fails to generate power from the ground and transfer it smoothly through the arm to the blade, resulting in a less effective chop. Additionally, the person's body rotation and balance are not optimal during the movement. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a relaxed grip, utilizing proper footwork and body rotation for power generation, and ensuring smooth transitions between the left and right chops.
