The staff lift action in this video is bad. The person starts with a balanced stance, but the grip on the staff is not ideal as it is closer to one end rather than being held closer to the body for better leverage. The upward motion of the staff is not smooth and controlled; instead, there is a jerky movement that could result from improper technique. The person's legs are not explosively extended, which is crucial for generating force during the lift. Additionally, the person's arms do not begin to lift the staff simultaneously with the legs, leading to an uncoordinated motion. To improve, the person should ensure proper grip, maintain balance, use a smooth and controlled upward motion, and coordinate the leg and arm movements effectively.
