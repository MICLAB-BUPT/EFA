The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The individual begins with a stable stance, holding the staff firmly. They prepare for the lifting motion by positioning the staff low to the ground and coiling their body to generate upward power. As they lift the staff upwards, they execute the upward flicking or scooping action with precision. The wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff, generating power from the legs and core. After completing the lifting and flicking motion, the person transitions smoothly into another technique, maintaining balance and control throughout. This sequence demonstrates a well-executed and fluid lifting and stirring staff form.
