The spear twist action in this video is good. The player begins in a stable stance, preparing to engage with the opponent's weapon. The grip on the spear is firm but adaptable, allowing for control and the necessary twisting motion. The contact point is closer to the player's hands than to the spearhead, providing leverage. The player uses a combination of wrist, arm, and body rotation to execute the twisting motion smoothly and deliberately. The force is applied continuously, avoiding sudden jerks that could compromise balance or control. The player maintains constant pressure and control during the twisting motion, preventing the opponent from easily freeing their weapon. Finally, the player completes the twisting motion by disarming the opponent, creating an opening for further techniques.
