The crushing staff action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance with a firm grip on the staff, preparing for the 'Beng' action by slightly coiling the body to generate potential energy. They initiate the 'Beng Gun' with a powerful, explosive upward strike, delivering the movement diagonally and striking with the tip of the staff. The body rises slightly with the upward motion, maintaining balance and control throughout the technique.
