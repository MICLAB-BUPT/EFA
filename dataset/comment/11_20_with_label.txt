The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The character's elbows are not close to the torso, which can lead to poor muscle engagement and increased risk of injury. Additionally, the wrists are not straight, which may cause strain on the wrists during the exercise. To improve this, the character should focus on keeping their elbows close to the torso and ensuring that their wrists remain straight throughout the movement.
