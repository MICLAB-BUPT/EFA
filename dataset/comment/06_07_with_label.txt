The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The person maintains a neutral spine and keeps the bar close to their legs, which are crucial aspects of proper form. They also maintain tension in their hamstrings throughout the lift, ensuring that they are engaged during the exercise. Additionally, the person demonstrates control as they lower and raise the bar, avoiding any unnecessary hyperextension at the top of the movement. However, it's important to note that maintaining a slight bend in the knees is recommended for better stability and reduced risk of injury.
