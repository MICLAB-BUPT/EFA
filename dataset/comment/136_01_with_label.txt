The sword thrust action in this video is good. The character maintains a balanced stance with the sword held firmly, initiating the thrust smoothly from the core and extending through the arm. The step forward with the front leg adds power to the thrust, maintaining alignment from the back heel to the tip of the sword. The full extension of the arm and body at the completion of the thrust showcases control and precision. There are no visible flaws or minor refinements that could enhance the performance further.
