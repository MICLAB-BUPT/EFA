The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The person demonstrates a controlled and fluid motion while performing the technique. They maintain a stable stance throughout, which is crucial for balance and power transmission. The grip on the staff is firm and precise, allowing for accurate execution of the movements. Additionally, the person's body position and the way they transfer power from their legs to the upper body are well-executed. There is minimal unnecessary movement, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the technique. While there are no visible flaws, the performer could refine their technique by focusing on finer details such as the timing of the wrist flick and the angle of the staff during the upward motion. These refinements would enhance the fluidity and precision of the action, making it even more refined and effective.
