The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The woman lies flat on her back with feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other, and extends her arms straight up above the chest while keeping a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. She maintains a stable torso on the bench by bracing her core and avoiding excessive arching of the lower back. The woman slowly lowers the dumbbells towards the forehead (or slightly behind the head for a greater stretch) by bending the elbows and then extends the arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement. Her breathing technique also appears to be well-coordinated, exhaling during the upward push and maintaining control throughout the exercise. Overall, her form is consistent with the ideal steps for performing a laying dumbbell triceps extension.
