The pull up action in this video is good. The man starts from a dead hang, grips the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and initiates the pull by engaging his back and shoulder muscles. He pulls his chin above the bar while maintaining a neutral head position and then slowly lowers back down to the starting dead hang position with full control. This sequence demonstrates proper form and technique for performing a standard pull up without any swinging or kipping, which is why it can be classified as 'good'.
