The spear crush action in this video is bad. The person's stance and grip on the broom are not optimal, leading to a less effective execution of the movement. Additionally, the motion appears rushed and lacks the necessary balance and control that would be ideal for a proper spear crush technique. To improve, the person should focus on establishing a stable stance, ensuring a firm yet relaxed grip, and maintaining balance throughout the thrust.
