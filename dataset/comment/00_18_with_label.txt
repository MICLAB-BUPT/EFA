The pull up action in this video is good. The individual grips the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. They begin from a dead hang and initiate the pull by engaging their back and shoulder muscles, pulling their shoulder blades down and back. The chin is above the bar, demonstrating proper form. To further enhance their technique, they could ensure a neutral head position throughout the movement and slowly lower back down to the starting dead hang position with full control.
