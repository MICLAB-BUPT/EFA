The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The woman maintains a stable torso and engages her core, demonstrating proper technique. She uses the heels to drive through the hips while keeping her back straight, achieving full hip extension. Her arms remain relatively straight but not locked out, providing stability without causing unnecessary strain. The pause at the top of the bridge showcases controlled movement, emphasizing glute engagement.
