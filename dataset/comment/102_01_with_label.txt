The bow stance punch action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance with their feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, which allows for balance and stability. They step forward with one leg while bending the front knee to approximately 90 degrees, demonstrating proper form for the 'Gong Bu' stance. The punch is initiated simultaneously with the step, showing a coordinated movement between footwork and arm positioning. The punching arm is extended forward with the fist aiming at chest level, indicating a strong and controlled strike. The non-punching hand remains in a guard position, ready for any adjustments or counter-moves. The character maintains balance throughout the technique, using the power generated from the stance and body rotation. These aspects of the bow stance punch align well with the ideal action steps provided, making it a well-executed and effective martial arts maneuver.
