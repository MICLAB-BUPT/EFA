The sweeping staff action in this video is bad. The person starts with a basic stance but quickly loses balance, leading to an unstable and ineffective execution of the technique. They fail to maintain a stable base or a proper grip on the staff, resulting in a poorly executed motion. To improve, they should focus on establishing a strong foundation, maintaining control over the staff, and ensuring fluidity and precision in their movements.
