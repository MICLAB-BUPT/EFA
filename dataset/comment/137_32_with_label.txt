The sword point action in this video is bad. The character fails to initiate a small, controlled step or shift in body weight towards the target, which results in an uncontrolled motion and less precise contact with the target. To improve, the character should focus on making subtle and quick movements towards the target, using the wrist and forearm for power, and ensuring a light and fast 'point' to achieve greater accuracy.
