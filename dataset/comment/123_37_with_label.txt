The back flourish action in this video is bad because the person's movements are not fluid and continuous, which affects the overall execution of the technique. The blade should be maintained under control at all times, but it appears to be out of control in certain frames. To improve, the person should focus on developing better wrist, elbow, and shoulder coordination, ensuring that the movements are smooth and deliberate throughout the sequence.
