The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The person starts by assuming a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ) with their feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward, which is ideal for maintaining stability and power. Their knees are deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground, showcasing proper form and technique. The person positions their hands in a scooping/raking motion ('Lou Shou'), starting from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards, demonstrating controlled and fluid movement. The execution of the 'Lou Shou' technique is also well-executed, using the power generated from the 'Ma Bu' and the rotation of the waist. Overall, the person maintains the 'Ma Bu' throughout the movement, providing stability and power, and completes the technique with precision.
