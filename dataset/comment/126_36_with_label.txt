The staff chop action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not stable, as they are standing on one leg with the other leg bent at the knee, which may lead to instability during the movement. The grip on the staff appears to be less than ideal, which could affect control and precision. The execution of the 'Pi' (chopping) motion seems rushed, lacking the necessary power and control that a proper chop would require. To improve, the character should ensure a stable stance, a firm grip on the staff, and a controlled, powerful downward strike.
