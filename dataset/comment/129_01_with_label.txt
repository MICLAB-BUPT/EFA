The spear crush action in this video is good. The person begins in a stable stance with firm but not tense grip on the spear, which allows for forward lunging and power generation. They initiate the movement by stepping forward with the front leg, transferring weight and initiating a forward lunge, providing the initial momentum and setting the body in motion for the thrust. The person extends the rear arm forward, driving the spearhead in a straight line towards the target, with the core of the 'bursting' action coming from the explosive extension of the arm and the forward momentum of the body. The front hand guides the spear's direction, ensuring the point remains on target throughout the thrust. After completing the thrust with full extension of the arm and body, the person maintains balance and control.
