The horse stance punch action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a strong foundation with their feet positioned wide apart and knees bent, which is essential for stability during the punch. Their hands are positioned effectively, one chambered at the waist while the other hand supports balance. The execution of the punch shows a clear rotation of the waist and a forward extension of the arm, indicating good form. However, to refine their technique, the individual could focus on ensuring that the fist remains vertical or slightly angled throughout the punch, rather than being fully extended as seen in the video. This would improve the precision and power of the punch while maintaining balance and stability.
