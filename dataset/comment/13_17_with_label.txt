The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The woman lies flat on the mat with her feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. She extends her arms straight up above her chest, keeping a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. Her upper arms remain stationary throughout the exercise, and she takes a breath and braces her core, maintaining a stable torso on the bench. As she lowers the dumbbells towards her forehead (or slightly behind her head for a greater stretch), she bends her elbows slowly, maintaining control and keeping her upper arms perpendicular to the floor. Finally, she extends her arms back to the starting position by contracting her triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement.
