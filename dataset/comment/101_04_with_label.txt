The left and right shuttle action in this video is good. The practitioner maintains a consistent flow of movement, transitioning smoothly from one side to the other while performing the ward-off and pushing motions with precision. The form appears balanced and controlled, showcasing proper technique and execution of the Tai Chi sequence. To further enhance their performance, the practitioner could focus on maintaining a steady pace, ensuring that each step and arm movement is deliberate and fluid. This would help in refining the shuttle movement and improving overall coordination and grace.
