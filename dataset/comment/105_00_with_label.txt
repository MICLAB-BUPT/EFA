The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The person starts in a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ), with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, knees deeply bent, and the core engaged. Both hands are positioned in a guard position, ready for the downward chopping strikes. The individual initiates the 'Shuang Pi Quan' ( shuang pi quan ), bringing both fists down forcefully while maintaining stability and power. The elbows are slightly bent at the point of impact, and the fists are angled downwards. After the strikes, the person retracts the fists back to a guard position or chambered position, and the 'Ma Bu' is maintained throughout the entire movement. These aspects align with the ideal standards for performing the horse stance double chopping fist, resulting in a well-executed technique.
