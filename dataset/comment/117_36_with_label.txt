The sword chop action in this video is bad. The character starts with a stable stance but quickly loses balance and control of the sword, resulting in an awkward and uncontrolled movement. The execution of the 'Pi' (splitting) action is also poorly executed, with the sword not being properly positioned for a clean cut. Additionally, the finishing position is suboptimal, lacking proper form and technique. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining balance, controlling the sword's movement, and practicing the 'Pi' action to ensure a clean and powerful cut.
