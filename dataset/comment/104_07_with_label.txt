The horse stance gather hand action in this video is good. The person begins by assuming a solid 'Ma Bu' ( ma bu ) stance, with their feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward or slightly outward. Their knees are deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground, back straight, and core engaged. They position their hands, typically one hand performing the 'Lou Shou' ( lou shou , scooping/raking hand), while the other might be in a guard position or chambered at the waist. The specific initial hand positioning can vary. The person initiates the 'Lou Shou' movement, which involves a sweeping, scooping, or raking motion of the hand, typically starting from a higher position and moving downwards and inwards, or from a lower position moving outwards and upwards, often in a circular or semi-circular path. The palm is usually open. The person executes the 'Lou Shou', using the power generated from the 'Ma Bu' and the rotation of the waist. The arm is relaxed but firm, and the movement is controlled and fluid. The specific trajectory and target of the 'Lou Shou' will depend on its intended application (defense, grabbing, etc.). Finally, the person completes the 'Lou Shou' and returns the hand to a guard position or chambered position at the waist, maintaining the 'Ma Bu' stance throughout the movement, providing stability and power.
