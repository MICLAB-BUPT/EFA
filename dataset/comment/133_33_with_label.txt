The spear flourish action in this video is bad. The character is not holding the spear near the center or slightly towards the rear, which makes it difficult to control and execute the movements smoothly. Additionally, the character's grip on the spear is not firm enough, leading to an unstable stance and less fluid movements. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a balanced stance with a firm grip on the spear and practice transitioning smoothly between different patterns while incorporating body movements to enhance the flow and dynamism of the dance.
