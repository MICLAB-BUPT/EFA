The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The person maintains a proper grip with the barbell, keeping their back straight and core engaged throughout the exercise. Their elbows move out and up to the sides as they pull the barbell towards their chest level, demonstrating good form. The controlled descent back to the starting position also indicates good technique. However, there is no significant difference between the initial and final positions of the barbell, suggesting that the person might have been lifting lighter weights or not fully engaging their muscles during the exercise.
