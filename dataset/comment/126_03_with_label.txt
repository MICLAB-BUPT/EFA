The staff chop action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance throughout the movement, providing a solid foundation for the powerful downward strike. The grip on the Nangun is firm and controlled, allowing for better leverage during the action. The body coiled slightly as it prepares for the 'Pi' (chopping or splitting) action, effectively storing potential energy. The downward striking motion of the 'Pi Gun' is executed with force and precision, transferring power from the ground through the arms to the staff. The non-wielding hand contributes to the balance and momentum of the movement. Overall, the character demonstrates good form and technique in executing the staff chop.
