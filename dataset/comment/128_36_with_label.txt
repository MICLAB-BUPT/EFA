The staff lift action in this video is bad. The character starts with an improper stance, as they are not in a balanced position and their feet are not shoulder-width apart or in a fighting stance. Additionally, the grip on the staff is not close to one end, which can affect leverage during the lift. The character also does not bend their knees slightly before explosively extending their legs upward, leading to a less efficient use of momentum. Lastly, the character's arms do not begin to lift the staff simultaneously with the upward motion of the body, which would result in a less coordinated and more difficult lift. To improve, the character should start with a balanced stance, maintain proper grip, bend their knees before extending, and coordinate the arm and leg movements for a smoother lift.
