The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by standing with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the dumbbells with palms facing the body and elbows slightly bent. They maintain an upright posture with a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise, avoiding locking them out. The movement is controlled, initiated from the shoulders, and the individual focuses on lifting with the medial deltoids. The lowering phase is also slow and controlled, emphasizing muscle growth and strength development.
