The staff throw action in this video is bad. The character starts with a firm grip on the staff, but there is no mention of the stance being stable or the core rotation being initiated. The arms are not extended outward as the core rotation continues, and the release of the staff occurs too early, resulting in a loss of power and accuracy. The follow-through is also not mentioned, which could lead to an imbalance and potential injury. To improve, the character should ensure a stable stance, initiate core rotation, extend the arms correctly, release the staff at the right moment, and maintain proper follow-through.
