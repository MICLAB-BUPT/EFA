The staff flourish action in this video is good. The person demonstrates proper grip and control of the staff, initiating the 'Wu' (dance) movement with fluid motions. The execution of the 'Hua' (flower) pattern is precise, showcasing clear, continuous movements. Additionally, the stance is stable and balanced throughout the performance, allowing for a seamless flow of technique. These aspects contribute to an effective and refined demonstration of the staff form.
