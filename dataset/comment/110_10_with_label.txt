The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The person maintains a balanced stance throughout the sequence, with their feet firmly planted on the ground. They exhibit a fluid motion while executing the chops, ensuring that the weight is transferred effectively from the ground up to the blade. The hand holding the sword is firm yet relaxed, and the arm's movement is smooth and controlled. The transitions between the left and right chops are seamless, with a proper turn of the body and shifting of weight to maintain balance. Overall, the performance demonstrates good technique and form, with minimal space for improvement.
