The spear crush action in this video is bad. The character's execution lacks the necessary control and precision to perform a proper spear thrust. In the first frame, the character stands in a static position without initiating any movement. In the second frame, the character starts moving forward with the spear, but the arm extension and body momentum are not fully utilized. By the third frame, the character has completed the thrust but fails to maintain balance and control throughout the motion. To improve, the character should focus on a stable stance, proper grip, and explosive arm extension while maintaining balance and control during the thrust.
