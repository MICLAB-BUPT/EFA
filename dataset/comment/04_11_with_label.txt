The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The individual approaches the barbell with their feet positioned hip-width apart and the bar over mid-foot, demonstrating a stable stance. They also maintain a neutral spine by engaging their core and pulling their shoulder blades down and back, which is crucial for proper form. Additionally, they take a deep breath and brace the core before initiating the lift, showing awareness of core engagement. The person then drives through the heels, extending the legs and hips simultaneously while keeping the bar close to the body, maintaining tension throughout the movement. Lastly, they lower the bar under control by reversing the motion, pushing the hips back first, then bending the knees, ensuring a controlled descent. Overall, the actions demonstrate a solid foundation in proper barbell deadlift technique.
