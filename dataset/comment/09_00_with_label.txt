The incline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual is lying on the inclined bench with their feet flat on the floor, which is an ideal position for the exercise. They are gripping the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using a full grip, which is appropriate for maintaining stability and control during the lift. The person unracks the barbell with arms extended and core engaged, taking a deep breath before lowering the barbell under control to the upper chest area. The elbows are tucked in at a roughly 45-75 degree angle, avoiding excessive flaring. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending the arms while maintaining a slight bend in the elbows at the top. The core is engaged throughout the movement, ensuring proper form and reducing the risk of injury. Overall, the individual demonstrates a well-executed incline barbell bench press technique.
