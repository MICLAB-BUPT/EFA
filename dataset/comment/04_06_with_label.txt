The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The woman demonstrates the correct approach by positioning her feet hip-width apart with the bar over the mid-foot, gripping it with an overhand or mixed grip, and engaging her core. She also maintains a neutral spine throughout the movement, which helps to prevent injury and ensures proper form. The woman initiates the lift by driving through her heels and extending her legs and hips simultaneously, while keeping the bar close to her body. Finally, she lowers the bar under control, maintaining a straight back and engaged core. These aspects of her technique contribute to the overall effectiveness and safety of the barbell deadlift.
