The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The character maintains a firm grip on the sword, ensuring precision and control during the chop. The execution of the movement is fluid, with a clear transition between the two sides, showcasing balance and coordination. The technique is well-practiced, reflecting proper form and technique. However, there is still room for refinement, such as enhancing the fluidity of the transitions and maintaining consistent speed throughout the sequence.
