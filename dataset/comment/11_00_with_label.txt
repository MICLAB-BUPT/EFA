The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form by keeping the elbows close to the torso and engaging the core muscles. The person's focus on squeezing the biceps at the top of the movement also contributes to effective muscle contraction. However, there may be room for slight refinement in terms of maintaining a controlled lowering phase, as well as ensuring that the wrists remain straight throughout the exercise.
