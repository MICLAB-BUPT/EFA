The pull up action in this video is good. The individual grips the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and starts from a dead hang. They engage their back and shoulder muscles to initiate the pull, pulling their shoulder blades down and back while keeping their elbows down towards their ribs. The person continues pulling until their chin is above the bar, demonstrating control throughout the movement.
