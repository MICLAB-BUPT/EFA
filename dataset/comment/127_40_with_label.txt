The staff throw action in this video is bad. The person starts by holding the staff with both hands, which is not ideal as they should typically hold it near the center or slightly towards one end depending on the specific technique being used. Additionally, there is no visible core rotation or hip movement, which are crucial for generating momentum. The person's stance is stable, but it doesn't seem to provide a solid base for power generation. Furthermore, the arms are not used as levers; instead, they are simply extended outward without proper control. Lastly, the release of the staff is not precise, and the follow-through is minimal, indicating poor coordination and balance.
