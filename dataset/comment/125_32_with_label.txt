The staff parry action in this video is bad. The character fails to maintain a stable stance and does not properly position the Nangun to intercept an incoming attack. Additionally, the movement is not quick or controlled, and there is a lack of precision and timing. To improve, the character should focus on establishing a firm grip on the staff, maintaining balance with the non-wielding hand, and executing a sharp, controlled motion to effectively deflect the attack.
