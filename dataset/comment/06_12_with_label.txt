The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits a critical fault by using the back (lumbar flexion) to achieve depth instead of properly initiating the movement with a hip hinge (posterior pelvic tilt). This results in a rounded lower back at the bottom of the movement, which places high shear forces on the lumbar discs, making the exercise dangerous. Although the knees are slightly bent, the focus is entirely on spinal movement rather than stretching the hamstrings. Furthermore, the bar drifts slightly away from the body during the eccentric phase, increasing the moment arm on the lower back. To execute a proper stiff-leg deadlift (or Romanian Deadlift), the athlete must maintain a rigidly neutral spine, initiate the movement by pushing the hips back, and stop the descent just before the lumbar spine is forced to round, ensuring the bar grazes the legs throughout.
