The nunchaku flourish action in this video is bad. The character's grip on the nunchaku handle is not firm and relaxed, which makes it difficult to perform smooth movements. Additionally, the wrist, arm, and shoulder rotations are not controlled or continuous, resulting in an unsteady flow of motion. There is a lack of balance and fluidity in the body movement, leading to a less dynamic performance. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a firm yet relaxed grip, performing controlled and continuous wrist, arm, and shoulder rotations, and incorporating more balanced body movements to enhance the overall flow and dynamism of the nunchaku flourish.
