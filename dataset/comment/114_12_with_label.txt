The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the staff firmly with a firm grip. The preparation for the 'Ti' (lifting) action involves positioning the staff low near the ground, ready to generate upward power. As the character initiates the 'Ti Liao Gun' (lifting and scooping) technique, they lift the staff upwards, creating an upward and outward scooping motion. The wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff, generating power from the legs and core. Finally, the character retracts the staff to a guard position after completing the 'Ti Liao' movement. Throughout the action, the focus is on maintaining balance and control, ensuring a fluid and precise performance.
