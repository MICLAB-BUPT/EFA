The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person lies face up on the floor with knees bent and feet flat, hip-width apart, and places a barbell across their hips. They take a deep breath and brace the core, engaging the abdominal muscles to stabilize the torso. They drive through the heels, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. Finally, they hold the bridge position for a brief pause before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control.
