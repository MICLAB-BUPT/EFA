The left and right shuttle action in this video is good. The person begins from a balanced stance, with the body centered and relaxed, preparing for the shifting and turning involved in 'Zuo You Chuan Suo'. They shift their weight onto one leg and step diagonally forward and outward, establishing a bow stance ( gong bu , gōng bù), similar to 'Ye Ma Fen Zong' (Parting Wild Horse's Mane). The body turns towards the stepping leg, creating a smooth transition into the movement. As they step, the person performs a ward-off and pushing motion with their arms, with one arm moving forward and outward in a warding-off action while the other hand pushes forward, often from near the waist or chest. The forward arm is in a ward-off position (palm facing outward), while the other arm is extended forward in a pushing position (palm facing forward), creating a diagonal line of force. The person then completes the bow stance, with the front knee bent (approximately over the ankle) and the back leg extended. The forward arm is in a ward-off position (palm facing outward), while the other arm is extended forward in a pushing position (palm facing forward). This creates a diagonal line of force. Finally, the person repeats the movement on the opposite side, shifting weight, stepping diagonally with the other leg, and performing the ward-off and push with the opposite arms. This alternating movement from side to side is the 'Zuo You' (left-right) aspect of 'Chuan Suo' (shuttle).
