The tai chi sword stir action in this video is good. The person starts with a stable stance, holding the sword naturally and maintaining a centered posture. They initiate the upward movement from the wrist and forearm, guiding the sword in a smooth arc, which is a crucial aspect of tai chi sword techniques. The elbow remains slightly bent, ensuring control over the blade's edge. The person completes the 'Liao' by bringing the sword to a position where it can continue into another technique or return to a guard position, demonstrating fluidity and precision. The overall form is well-coordinated, with the wrist remaining flexible throughout the motion.
