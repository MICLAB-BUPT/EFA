The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character's stance is not wide enough, with the feet being closer than shoulder-width apart and the toes pointing inward. Additionally, the knees are not deeply bent, and the thighs are not parallel to the ground. To improve, the character should widen their stance further, ensure their toes point outward, and maintain a deeper bend in the knees while keeping the thighs parallel to the ground.
