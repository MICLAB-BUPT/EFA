The spear twist action in this video is bad because the person is not using proper technique. The grip on the spear is not firm but adaptable, and the contact point is closer to the spearhead rather than the shaft. The twisting motion is not smooth and deliberate, and there is no constant pressure or control applied. To improve, the person should focus on maintaining a stable stance, using the shaft of the spear for contact, and applying controlled twisting motions with constant pressure.
