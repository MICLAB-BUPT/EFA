The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is bad because the person's back is not straight, and their posture is poor. This could lead to strain on the lower back and potential injury. To improve, the individual should focus on keeping their back straight, engaging their core, and using their legs to lift the weight rather than rounding their spine or using their arms to pull the weight up.
