The horse stance punch action in this video is good. The individual maintains a solid 'Ma Bu' with their feet positioned significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, and knees deeply bent, which allows for stability and balance during the punch. Their hands are positioned appropriately, with one chambered at the waist and the other in a guard position. The execution of the 'Chong Quan' thrusting punch is smooth, generating power from the ground through the legs and core. The arm extends forward, aiming for the target, and then retracts back to the chambered position at the waist, demonstrating control and precision.
