The standing barbell curl action in this video is good. The individual maintains a firm grip on the barbell, keeping their elbows close to the torso and maintaining a steady stance with feet shoulder-width apart. They also engage their core for stability, ensuring that all movement originates from the elbow joint. This controlled approach helps maintain proper form and reduces the risk of injury. To further enhance the performance, the person could focus on maintaining a consistent pace throughout the exercise, ensuring smooth and fluid movements during both the ascent and descent phases of the curl.
