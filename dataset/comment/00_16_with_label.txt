The pull up action in this video is good. The man grips the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and starts from a dead hang, engaging his back and shoulder muscles to initiate the pull. His chin goes above the bar as he pulls himself up, and he maintains control throughout the movement before slowly lowering back down to the starting position. There are no visible signs of swinging or kipping, indicating a controlled and steady performance.
