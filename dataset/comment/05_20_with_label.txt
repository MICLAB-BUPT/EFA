The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual is lying on the floor with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. They have positioned the barbell across the hips, resting it in the hip crease, which is ideal for proper form. The person's hands are placed on the barbell to stabilize it, ensuring a secure grip while keeping their arms relatively straight but not locked out. The core is braced, and the individual drives through the heels, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the floor until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. The person maintains the bridge position for a brief pause at the top, holding the form before slowly lowering the hips back down to the floor with control.
