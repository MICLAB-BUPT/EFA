The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a strong core engagement, as seen by the bracing of the abdominal muscles and pulling of the belly button towards the spine. This helps maintain a stable torso during the lift. The person also maintains proper form throughout the movement, with the hips forming a straight line from shoulders to knees. They execute the drive through the heels effectively, squeezing the glutes to lift the hips off the ground. Additionally, the individual lowers the hips back down to the floor with control, avoiding any quick or forceful movements that could lead to injury or improper form. Overall, the actions are performed with good technique, demonstrating a solid foundation for building strength and stability in the glute muscles.
