The elbow whip action in this video is bad because the person does not start with a stable stance and the whip is not extended or partially coiled. The person's elbow positioning is also incorrect, as they are not using it as a pivot point or redirection point for the whip. Additionally, the whip is not swung in a circular or figure-eight pattern, and there is no control over the whip's movement. To improve, the person should start with a stable stance, position their elbow correctly, and swing the whip in a controlled manner to execute proper elbow whip form.
