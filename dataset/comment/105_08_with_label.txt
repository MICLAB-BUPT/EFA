The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The person starts in a solid 'Ma Bu' (horse stance) with their feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, knees deeply bent, and back straight. They position both hands in front of them, forming fists ready for the downward chopping strikes. The person initiates the 'Shuang Pi Quan' (double chopping fists) by bringing both fists down forcefully, generating power from the core and the downward movement of the arms. After executing the strikes, they retract the fists back to a guard position or chambered position, maintaining the 'Ma Bu' throughout the entire movement. The actions are fluid and controlled, demonstrating good technique and form.
