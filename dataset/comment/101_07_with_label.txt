The left and right shuttle action in this video is good. The person maintains a relaxed, centered stance throughout the sequence, which is essential for Tai Chi movements. They execute the stepping motion correctly, shifting their weight onto one leg and extending it diagonally forward to form a bow stance. The arm movements are fluid and coordinated with the steps, performing a ward-off and pushing motion that creates a diagonal line of force. The person also demonstrates proper body rotation and alignment, ensuring smooth transitions between the left and right shuttle movements. These aspects contribute to an effective and precise demonstration of the Tai Chi form.
