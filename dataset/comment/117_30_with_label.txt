The sword chop action in this video is bad. The character's grip on the sword is not firm, and there is a lack of control over the blade's angle during the downward motion. Additionally, the movement appears to be rushed, which compromises the power and precision of the cut. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a strong grip, ensuring proper blade angle, and executing the movement with controlled speed and power.
