The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The character starts in a solid horse stance with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward, and knees deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground. The hands are positioned in front of the waist, forming fists ready for the downward chopping strikes. The character initiates the double chopping fists, bringing both fists down forcefully while maintaining the core engagement and stability provided by the horse stance. The character's elbows are slightly bent at the point of impact, and the fists are angled slightly downwards. After the strikes, the character retracts the fists back to a guard position, maintaining the horse stance throughout the entire movement.
