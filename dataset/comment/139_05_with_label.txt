The sword sweep action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance with the sword held firmly but not rigidly, ensuring proper core engagement for stability and power. The sweeping motion originates from the waist and hips, with the body rotating in the intended direction. The blade angle remains consistent throughout the sweep, and the arm extension is controlled and smooth. The stepping motion enhances reach and power while maintaining balance. The character completes the sweep with a controlled stop, ready for the next movement.
