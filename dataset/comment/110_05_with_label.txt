The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form and technique throughout the sequence, starting with a preparatory stance and transitioning smoothly into the 'Pi Dao' (chopping) motion on both sides. The movements are fluid and controlled, showing a strong understanding of the form. The character maintains balance and coordination while executing the chops, ensuring that the weight is transferred from the ground through the legs to the arm and finally to the blade. This results in a well-executed and precise demonstration of the chopping knife form.
