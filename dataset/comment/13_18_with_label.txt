The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The person starts by lying on the floor with their feet flat on the ground, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing forward. They then extend their arms straight up above their chest while keeping a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out. Throughout the exercise, they keep their upper arms stationary and focus on movement at the elbow joint. They also maintain control of the dumbbells, keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the floor. As they lower the dumbbells towards their forehead, they slowly bend the elbows, and as they extend their arms back to the starting position, they contract the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement. The person exhales during the upward push and avoids locking out the elbows. These actions demonstrate proper form and technique for the laying dumbbell triceps extension exercise.
