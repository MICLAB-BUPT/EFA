The barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The person starts by lying face-up on the bench with their feet flat on the floor, but they do not maintain a stable base as their feet are not flat. Additionally, they grip the barbell too close to their body, which can cause strain and injury. The person unracks the barbell without the help of a spotter, which increases the risk of injury if they lose control. They lower the barbell down towards their chest, but they touch it to their lower chest instead of around the nipple line, which can lead to improper muscle engagement. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position, but they do not maintain a controlled and steady pressing motion, which can also lead to injury.
