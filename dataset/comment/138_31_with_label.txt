The tai chi sword stir action in this video is bad. The character starts with a stable stance, but the execution of the upward movement (Liao) from the wrist and forearm is not smooth and arcing as described. Instead, it appears rushed and lacks precision. Additionally, the elbow is overly extended, which may lead to instability. The power comes from the waist rotation, but the character does not coordinate the upward arc with a subtle shift in body weight or a slight rotation of the waist. The final position is not clearly defined, and the wrist does not remain flexible for the transition. To improve, the character should focus on a more controlled and fluid motion, maintaining proper form and coordination throughout the technique.
