The sweeping staff action in this video is bad. The character begins with a stable stance, but the grip on the staff is not firm enough, and the stance is not well-balanced. During the sweeping motion, the body does not coil sufficiently to store potential energy. Additionally, the sweep is not fluid and continuous; instead, it appears abrupt and lacks control. The finishing position also seems hasty, lacking proper form. To improve, the character should ensure a firm grip, a balanced stance, a coiled body for energy storage, a smooth and controlled sweep, and a proper finishing position.
