The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The person maintains a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise, which helps to avoid locking them out and reduces the risk of injury. They keep their core engaged and maintain an upright posture with their chest up and shoulders back, demonstrating proper form that targets the intended muscle group. The person also focuses on lifting with the medial deltoids, as instructed, which ensures the exercise is performed correctly. Finally, they lower the dumbbells back to the starting position in a controlled manner, emphasizing the importance of the eccentric phase for muscle growth and strength development.
