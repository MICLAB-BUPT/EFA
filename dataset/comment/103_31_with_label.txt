The horse stance punch action in this video is bad. The character starts with an incorrect foot position, as the feet are not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart and are not pointed forward or slightly outward. This can affect balance and stability during the punch. Additionally, the character's knees are not deeply bent, which is essential for generating power from the ground. Lastly, the character's hands are not positioned correctly; one hand should be chambered at the waist in a fist while the other might be in a guard position or also chambered at the waist. These deviations from the ideal form make the punch less effective and potentially unsafe. To improve, the character should adjust their stance to be wider with pointed toes, ensure deep knee bends, and properly position their hands according to the style being practiced.
