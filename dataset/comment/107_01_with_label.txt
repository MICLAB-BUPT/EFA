The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is good. The individual maintains a firm but relaxed grip on the Dao, ensuring a controlled movement throughout the sequence. The 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) is executed correctly, with one leg bent at approximately 90 degrees and the other leg straight, providing a stable base for the thrust. The thrust itself is powerful and precise, with the arm extending forward to aim the tip of the blade towards the target. The transition from the preparatory stance to the 'Gong Bu' and the execution of the thrust are smooth and fluid, demonstrating good technique. There are no apparent areas of refinement needed as the actions are executed with precision and control.
