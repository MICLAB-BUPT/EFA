The left and right chopping knife action in this video is good. The person starts in a preparatory stance, holding the knife firmly but with a relaxed grip. They then initiate the chopping action on one side, raising the knife in an arc and bringing it down with power generated from the ground through the legs and core. The non-wielding hand assists in controlling the knife's momentum. After completing the chop on one side, they transition smoothly to the other side, repeating the motion. The footwork and transitions are well-executed, maintaining balance and control throughout the sequence.
