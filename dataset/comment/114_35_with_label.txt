The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is bad. The character begins with a stable stance, but the execution of the 'Ti' (lifting) motion is not ideal. The upward movement is abrupt and lacks fluidity, which may result in less power being generated and less control over the staff. To improve, the character should focus on a smoother and more controlled upward motion, ensuring that the wrist and forearm work together to flick the tip of the staff upwards and outwards effectively. Additionally, the character should maintain balance and control throughout the action, especially during the transition from the 'Ti' to the 'Liao' (flicking) motion.
