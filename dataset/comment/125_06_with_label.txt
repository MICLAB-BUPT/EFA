The staff parry action in this video is good. The character maintains a stable stance and grips the Nangun firmly, preparing for the Bo Gun (deflecting or parrying) action. They initiate the Bo with a quick, controlled movement, using their body to redirect an incoming attack. The focus on precision and timing is evident, and the character transitions smoothly into another technique after completing the Bo. Overall, the performance demonstrates proper technique and control, making it a well-executed staff parry.
