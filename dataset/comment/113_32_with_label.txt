The sweeping staff action in this video is bad. The character begins in a stable stance, but the positioning of the staff and the grip on it are not ideal. The stance is not stable, and the body is not coiled to store potential energy for the sweep. The initiation of the sweep is also not fluid or continuous, and the movement does not demonstrate proper control over the staff. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable stance, coiling the body for energy, and executing a smooth, controlled sweep with proper grip and form.
