The staff point action in this video is bad because the person does not initiate the 'Dian Gun' with a quick, precise, and controlled thrusting movement. Instead, they perform a sweeping motion that lacks the sharpness and power typically associated with this technique. To improve, the person should focus on generating power from the ground through their legs and core, transferring it smoothly through their arms to execute a precise jab.
