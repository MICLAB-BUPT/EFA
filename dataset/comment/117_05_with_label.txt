The sword chop action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a stable stance and a relaxed grip on the sword, which are essential for maintaining balance and control during the chop. The person's arm positioning and wrist movement indicate a proper technique for generating power and ensuring a clean cut. The transition from the preparatory position to the downward chopping motion appears fluid and controlled. While there is no clear indication of the finishing position or the transition to the next movement, the overall execution of the 'Pi' ( pi ) action is precise and well-executed, showcasing the practitioner's skill and understanding of the form.
