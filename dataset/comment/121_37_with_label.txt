The rope slide action in this video is bad. The character's grip on the rope is not secure enough, and they are not holding it in a way that allows for smooth control of the 'Liu Sheng' action. This could lead to difficulty in controlling the speed and tension of the rope, which is essential for proper execution of the technique. To improve, the character should practice maintaining a firm yet controlled grip on the rope, ensuring that their fingers and palm are used to regulate the movement. They should also focus on developing better hand-eye coordination and precision when manipulating the rope during the 'Liu Sheng' action.
