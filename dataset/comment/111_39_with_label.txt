The crushing staff action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a stable stance, as they are standing on one leg and holding the staff with both hands. This compromises their balance and control during the movement. To improve, the person should start in a stable stance, either a horse stance or a bow stance, with a firm grip on the staff near the center or slightly off-center.
