The downward staff chop action in this video is bad. The character starts with a firm grip on the nunchaku, but there are deviations from the ideal form. First, the stance appears to be stable, but the arm extension during the downward swing lacks full rotation involving the hips and core, which reduces power generation. Second, the wrist is not firm enough, leading to less control over the snapping motion at the point of impact. Lastly, the follow-through is not fully executed, as the character does not allow the nunchaku to continue its natural arc after impact, which could compromise balance and control. To improve, the character should ensure full hip and core rotation, maintain a firm wrist, and complete the follow-through for better technique.
