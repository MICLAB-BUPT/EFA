The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form by keeping the elbows at a 45-75 degree angle and extending their arms fully while pressing the barbell upwards. There is no indication of violent lockout or excessive movement, suggesting a controlled and steady motion. This technique ensures effective use of chest muscles and minimizes unnecessary strain on the shoulders and back.
