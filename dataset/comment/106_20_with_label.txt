The bow stance head wrap action in this video is good. The character begins in a preparatory stance, holding the broadsword with a firm but relaxed grip. They transition smoothly into the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) with one leg stepping forward and bending to approximately 90 degrees while the back leg remains straight. The character then initiates the 'Chan Tou' (head-wrapping action) by moving the broadsword around their head in a controlled circular motion without making contact. The movement is fluid and driven by the wrist, forearm, and body rotation. The character maintains the 'Gong Bu' throughout the action, showcasing good technique and control. Overall, the execution of the bow stance head wrap is precise and well-executed, demonstrating skillful handling of the broadsword.
