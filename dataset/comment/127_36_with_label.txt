The staff throw action in this video is bad. The character fails to properly initiate the throw by rotating their hips and torso, instead using arm strength. This lack of core rotation leads to a loss of power and accuracy. The arms are not used as levers but rather as the primary source of power, which is inefficient for generating force. Furthermore, the release of the staff is not executed at the precise moment when the force vector is directed towards the intended target, resulting in a poor trajectory. Lastly, the follow-through is absent, which is crucial for maintaining balance and preventing injury.
