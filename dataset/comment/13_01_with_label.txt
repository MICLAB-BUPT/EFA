The laying dumbbell triceps extension action in this video is good. The individual is lying face up on a flat bench with their feet flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other, which is consistent with the initial position described in the ideal steps. They maintain a slight bend in the elbows to avoid locking them out, and there is minimal movement from the upper arms, keeping them stationary throughout the exercise. The person takes a breath and braces the core, maintaining a stable torso on the bench, which helps in avoiding excessive arching of the lower back. The individual slowly lowers the dumbbells towards the forehead while keeping control and maintaining the upper arms perpendicular to the floor. Finally, they extend the arms back to the starting position by contracting the triceps, focusing on squeezing the muscles at the top of the movement. However, the video only shows a partial motion, so it is unclear if the individual fully completes the exercise cycle.
