The bow stance punch action in this video is good. The person starts with a preparatory stance, with their feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, which is ideal for balance and stability. They then step forward with one leg while keeping the back leg straight, establishing the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance). This position allows for efficient power generation and control during the punch. Simultaneously, they initiate the punch with the opposite hand of the front leg, maintaining a vertical or slightly angled fist to maximize impact. The person extends the punching arm forward with proper form and balance, ensuring that the movement is fluid and controlled. Overall, the character demonstrates a well-executed bow stance punch that adheres to the ideal steps provided.
