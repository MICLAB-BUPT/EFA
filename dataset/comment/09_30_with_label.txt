The incline barbell bench press action in this video is bad. The person's elbows are flared out, which is not ideal for proper form and can lead to strain or injury. To improve, the individual should tuck their elbows in at a roughly 45-75 degree angle to the body, avoiding excessive flaring. Additionally, the person's core is not engaged, which is crucial for stability and control during the exercise. Engaging the core would help maintain proper posture and prevent unnecessary strain on the back and shoulders.
