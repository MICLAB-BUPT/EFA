The lifting and stirring staff action in this video is good. The character starts with a stable stance, holding the staff firmly. They then initiate the lifting motion by raising the staff upwards with precision, demonstrating control and balance throughout the movement. This upward motion is combined with a forward or diagonal movement, creating an upward and outward scooping or raising action. The execution of the 'Liao' action involves flicking the tip of the staff upwards and outwards, showcasing skillful manipulation of the staff. The focus on maintaining balance and control is evident throughout the technique, making it an effective demonstration of the lifting and stirring staff form.
