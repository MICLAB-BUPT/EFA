The cloud sword action in this video is good. The performer maintains a balanced stance throughout the sequence, starting from a neutral position and transitioning into a slightly shifted stance. They execute smooth and even circular motions with the sword, demonstrating fluidity and control. The performer's elbow remains slightly bent and flexible, acting as a pivot point for the movements. The wrist and forearm guide the sword through continuous, flowing paths, showcasing precision and skill. The performer's non-sword hand mirrors the sword's motion, contributing to the overall balance and coordination of the technique. The movements are consistent in speed and rhythm, maintaining the continuous, flowing quality of the cloud sword form.
