The barbell deadlift action in this video is good. The man starts with the barbell positioned just outside his legs, gripping it with an overhand or mixed grip. He maintains a neutral spine by engaging his core and pulling his shoulder blades down and back. He takes a deep breath and braces the core before initiating the lift, driving through his heels and extending his legs and hips simultaneously. He keeps the bar close to his body, dragging it up the shins and thighs, maintaining a straight back throughout the movement. The man continues extending until standing upright with the hips and knees fully locked out, maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core. Finally, he lowers the bar under control by reversing the movement, pushing the hips back first, then bending the knees, keeping the bar close to the body.
