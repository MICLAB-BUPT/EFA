The staff chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, providing a solid foundation for the powerful downward strike. The Nangun (Southern Staff) is held with a firm grip, ensuring control and leverage during the movement. The preparation for the 'Pi' involves raising the Nangun above the head or shoulder, positioning it for a downward strike. The body coils slightly, storing potential energy for the 'Pi Gun' motion. The execution of the 'Pi' involves driving the Nangun downwards with force and precision, generating power from the ground through the legs and core. The transition to the next movement is smooth, showcasing the fluidity and skill involved in the technique.
