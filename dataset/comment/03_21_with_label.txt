The barbell upright row action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates proper form by standing with feet shoulder-width apart and maintaining a controlled grip on the barbell. They also keep their back straight, core engaged, and chest up throughout the exercise. Additionally, the person initiates the lift by pulling the barbell straight up, keeping it close to their body, and ensures that their elbows lead the movement, moving out and up to the sides. The exercise is performed at an appropriate speed, allowing for full control of the weight during both the ascent and descent phases.
