The sword thrust action in this video is good. The character begins in a balanced stance, holding the sword with a relaxed grip and maintaining proper alignment from the core through the arm. The extension of the arm is smooth and controlled, originating from the core and extending through the shoulder and arm. The step forward with the front leg is coordinated with the arm extension, adding power and reach to the thrust. The character maintains a straight line from the back heel, through the hips and shoulders, to the tip of the sword, ensuring maximum power and accuracy. Finally, the completion of the thrust with full extension of the arm and body showcases balance and control, with the tip of the sword being the point of contact.
