The spear crush action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance with the rear hand gripping the spear firmly, and the front hand guiding its direction. As they initiate the movement, the character steps forward with the front leg while simultaneously extending the rear arm to drive the spearhead towards the target. The front hand maintains balance and control throughout the thrust, ensuring the point remains on target. The character completes the thrust with full extension of the arm and body, demonstrating balance and control.
