The staff throw action in this video is bad. The person starts with a firm grip on the staff, but there is no clear indication of hip and torso rotation or arm extension during the throw. This lack of core engagement and proper form results in a loss of power and accuracy, making it difficult to control the direction and speed of the staff. To improve, the person should focus on generating momentum through hip and torso rotation and using their arms as levers to transfer the force to the staff. Additionally, precise timing and coordination are crucial for releasing the staff at the right moment.
