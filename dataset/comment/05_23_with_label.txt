The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The person lies face up on the floor with knees bent and feet flat, placing the barbell across their hips. They maintain a secure grip on the barbell, take a deep breath, brace the core, and drive through the heels to lift the hips off the ground. They hold the bridge position at the top, then lower the hips back down to the floor with control. The actions are performed with proper form and technique, making it an effective and safe exercise.
