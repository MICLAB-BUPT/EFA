The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is bad. The character's form is not ideal as he performs the 'Pu Bu' without maintaining a low, stable stance. His body is upright, which can lead to instability and difficulty in controlling the movement. To improve, the character should ensure that his 'Pu Bu' is accompanied by a drop of the body and a forward shift of weight, creating a balanced posture. Additionally, the 'Dai Dao' motion should be fluid and coordinated with the 'Pu Bu', using core strength and weight shifting for power. By correcting these deviations, the character can achieve better form and control during the pounce step carrying knife action.
