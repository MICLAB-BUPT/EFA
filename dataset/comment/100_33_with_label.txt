The cloud hands action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, which is a deviation from the ideal standards of Tai Chi form. The weight shift is abrupt and not gradual, and the hand movements are not circular or coordinated as they should be. Additionally, the eyes do not follow the upper hand, which is important for maintaining focus and awareness. To improve, the character should work on achieving a more relaxed, centered stance with even weight distribution and slightly bent knees. They should also practice shifting their weight gradually and continuously while maintaining the flow of the movement. The hand movements should be smooth and coordinated, with one hand moving upward and outward while the other moves downward and inward, without crossing directly. Finally, the eyes should follow the upper hand to maintain focus and awareness throughout the sequence.
