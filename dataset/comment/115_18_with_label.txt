The staff flourish action in this video is good. The individual demonstrates a firm yet relaxed grip on the staff, with hands spaced apart for better control. They initiate the 'Wu' (dance) movement of the staff, performing controlled, circular motions primarily driven by the wrists and forearms. The body rotation is evident as they create the 'Hua' (flower) or visual pattern with the staff. Throughout the video, the practitioner maintains a continuous, flowing motion while focusing on creating distinct patterns. The non-wielding hand is also coordinated for balance and to enhance the visual effect. The sequence showcases proficiency in maintaining control of the staff and executing clear, intricate movements, which aligns well with the ideal standards for Wu Hua Gun practice.
