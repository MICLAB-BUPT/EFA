The left and right shuttle action in this video is bad. The character starts by lifting one leg, which is not the correct starting position for a Tai Chi movement. The character then steps diagonally forward with their right leg, but the weight is not shifted properly onto the stepping leg. The arms are not positioned correctly for a ward-off and pushing motion, as one arm is not moving outward while the other is not pushing forward. Additionally, the body does not turn towards the stepping leg, which is crucial for maintaining balance and proper form. To improve, the character should start in a relaxed, centered position, shift weight onto the stepping leg, perform a diagonal step with the appropriate arm movements, and ensure the body turns towards the stepping leg to maintain proper form.
