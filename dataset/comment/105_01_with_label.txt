The horse stance double chopping fist action in this video is good. The character maintains a solid 'Ma Bu' with feet significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward, and knees deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground. The hands are positioned correctly, initially forming fists ready for the downward chopping strikes. The character initiates the 'Shuang Pi Quan' by bringing both fists down forcefully in a downward chopping motion, maintaining the power from the core and the downward movement of the arms. The elbows are slightly bent at the point of impact, and the fists are angled slightly inwards or downwards. After the strikes, the character retracts the fists back to a guard position, maintaining the 'Ma Bu' throughout the entire movement, providing stability and power. Overall, the execution of the horse stance double chopping fist is well-executed, demonstrating good technique and form.
