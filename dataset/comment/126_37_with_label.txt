The staff chop action in this video is bad. The character starts with a stable stance, but the following actions are not ideal. The character's movements are not fluid and controlled, which can result in poor form and potential injury. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper grip and balance throughout the movement, ensuring that the downward strike is powerful yet precise. Additionally, the character should practice transitioning smoothly between steps to enhance overall technique.
