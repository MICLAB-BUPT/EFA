The sword stir action in this video is bad. The character starts with a neutral stance but quickly loses balance and control, resulting in an uncoordinated movement. There are no proper transitions between movements, and the execution lacks precision and fluidity. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining a stable and balanced posture throughout the exercise, ensuring smooth transitions between different techniques, and refining their grip and wrist movements for better control of the sword.
