The standing barbell curl action in this video is bad. The athlete exhibits extreme full-body cheating, using a massive hip thrust and backward lean (momentum) to initiate and assist the concentric phase of the lift. This technique dramatically reduces the isolation of the biceps and transfers the workload to the lower back, increasing injury risk. Furthermore, the wrists are hyper-extended ("broken") at the top of the movement, placing unnecessary strain on the wrist joints. The eccentric (lowering) phase is also uncontrolled and too fast, sacrificing valuable time under tension. To correct this, the athlete must significantly reduce the weight to allow for a strict, isolated curl, maintaining a fixed, vertical torso and stable hips with the upper arms pinned to the sides. The wrists must be kept straight and neutral, and the weight lowered slowly and under complete control.
