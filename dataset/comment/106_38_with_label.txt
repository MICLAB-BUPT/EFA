The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The character's execution of the 'Chan Tou' involves making contact with the head, which is not ideal as it may cause injury or damage to the Dao. Additionally, the character's wrist and forearm are not coordinated to control the movement properly, leading to an unnatural motion. To improve, the character should practice maintaining a firm but relaxed grip on the Dao and execute the 'Chan Tou' without touching the head while keeping the wrist, forearm, and body rotation in sync for fluidity and control.
