The pounce step carrying knife action in this video is good. The character demonstrates proper form by transitioning from a preparatory stance to executing the 'Pu Bu' (drop step) while maintaining control of the Dao (broadsword). The simultaneous performance of the 'Dai Dao' (carrying/drawing action) with fluid and coordinated movements showcases the player's skill. Additionally, the player maintains a stable low stance throughout the sequence, ensuring balance and power generation. The transitions between movements are smooth, highlighting the player's mastery of the technique.
