The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains a stable base with feet flat on the floor, ensuring proper form and stability throughout the exercise. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip which helps distribute the weight evenly across the arms. The unracking of the barbell is done carefully, with straight arms to prevent injury and maintain control. The descent towards the chest is slow and controlled, with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle, indicating a focus on using chest muscles rather than flaring out or tucking them into the sides. Finally, the push back up to the starting position is executed with a steady and controlled motion, avoiding any violent lockout of the elbows. These actions demonstrate a well-executed barbell bench press technique that maximizes safety and effectiveness.
