The spinning whip action in this video is good. The person starts with a stable stance and holds the handle of the whip firmly, ready to deploy it. As they initiate the turn, their body rotation generates momentum for the whip's movement. They continue to swing the whip while maintaining balance and control throughout the sequence. The non-wielding hand assists in guiding the whip's trajectory. The person completes the turn and strike, bringing the whip to a controlled stop or transitioning into another technique. This demonstrates good technique and coordination during the spinning whip performance.
