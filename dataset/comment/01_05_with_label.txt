The barbell bench press action in this video is good. The individual maintains a stable base by lying face-up on the bench with their feet flat on the floor. They also grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, ensuring consistent grip width throughout the exercise. The unracking of the barbell and the controlled descent towards the chest are executed correctly, with elbows at a 45-75 degree angle. The push back up to the starting position is smooth and controlled, avoiding violent lockout of the elbows. Overall, the individual demonstrates good form and technique during the bench press.
