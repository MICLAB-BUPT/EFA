The sword point action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not precise or controlled, and the execution of the wrist snap is lacking power and accuracy. The initial stance is balanced but lacks agility, and the step towards the target is not quick enough to prepare for the rapid wrist action. Additionally, the contact with the target is not light and fast as it should be, and the retraction is not immediate, which compromises defense and readiness for subsequent movements. To improve, the character should focus on developing wrist flexibility, practicing quick and controlled movements, and refining the technique of making contact with the target with precision and speed.
