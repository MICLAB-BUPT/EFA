The barbell glute bridge action in this video is bad. The athlete is not performing a glute bridge but rather initiating a barbell hip thrust from the floor without the benefit of a bench for increased range of motion. Regardless, the fundamental flaw is the excessive lumbar hyperextension during the lift, indicated by the over-arching of the lower back at the top, which places unnecessary strain on the lumbar spine rather than maximally contracting the glutes. The athlete also maintains a poor head position, looking straight up, which prevents a proper posterior pelvic tilt. To correct this, the athlete must achieve a full posterior pelvic tilt before initiating the lift, keeping the ribs down and the core tight, and ensure the movement stops when the body forms a straight line from the knees to the shoulders, avoiding any lumbar hyperextension.
