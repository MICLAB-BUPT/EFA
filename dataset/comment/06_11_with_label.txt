The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form throughout the exercise, with feet positioned hip-width apart and the barbell over mid-foot. They hinge at the hips, push back while keeping their back straight and core engaged, lowering the bar as far as flexibility allows without rounding the spine or extending the knees excessively. The individual also stands up fully at the top of the lift, maintaining a neutral spine and slight knee bend. This indicates a well-executed stiff-leg deadlift, demonstrating control and technique that is consistent with the ideal steps provided.
