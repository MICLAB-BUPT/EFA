The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad. The character's execution of the 'Gong Bu' (bow stance) is not fully achieved, as one leg is not bent to approximately 90 degrees and the other leg remains straight with the heel on the ground. This deviation from the ideal form results in an unstable base for the technique. Additionally, the transition into the 'Zha Dao' (thrusting action) appears rushed and lacks the power and precision typical of a well-executed thrust. To improve, the character should ensure proper alignment of the legs, maintain balance during the thrust, and focus on controlled movements to enhance stability and effectiveness.
