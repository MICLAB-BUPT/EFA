The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The person demonstrates proper form by standing with feet hip-width apart, gripping the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, and keeping their back straight while bracing their core. They hinge at the hips, push the hips back, and maintain a slight bend in the knees throughout the lift. Additionally, they lower the bar as far as flexibility allows without rounding their spine or hyperextending their back. By maintaining tension in the hamstrings and feeling a stretch during the descent, they ensure proper muscle engagement. Finally, they drive through their heels to stand up fully, completing the lift with a neutral spine.
