The pull up action in this video is good. The person starts with a proper grip on the bar, which is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. They initiate the pull by engaging their back and shoulder muscles, pulling their shoulder blades down and back. Their chin goes above the bar, indicating that they have pulled themselves up successfully. Throughout the movement, they maintain control and avoid swinging or kipping. This controlled and precise execution of the pull-up exercise classifies it as 'good'.
