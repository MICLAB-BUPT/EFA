The crushing staff action in this video is bad because the person does not maintain a stable stance, which is crucial for balance and control. The body is not properly coiled or loaded before initiating the strike, resulting in an uncoordinated movement. Additionally, the arms are not extended upwards as they should be during the 'Beng Gun' technique. To improve, the person should start in a stable stance, prepare for the strike with proper coiling of the body, and execute the upward thrust with full extension of the arms.
