The barbell stiff-leg deadlift action in this video is good. The individual maintains a neutral spine, engages the core, and keeps the bar close to the legs throughout the lift. The person's feet are hip-width apart with the barbell over mid-foot, ensuring stability during the exercise. While there might be minor room for improvement, such as further refining the grip or adjusting the stance slightly, the overall execution of the stiff-leg deadlift demonstrates proper form and technique.
