The spear crush action in this video is bad. The character begins with a stable stance, but the grip on the spear is not firm enough and the front hand does not provide control over the spear's direction. As the character steps forward with the front leg, there is no visible extension of the rear arm or forward momentum to initiate the thrust. The character fails to maintain balance and control during the thrust, resulting in an ineffective and uncontrolled movement. To improve, the character should ensure a firm grip on the spear, guide the spearhead with the front hand, and extend both arms simultaneously to generate power and momentum for the thrust.
