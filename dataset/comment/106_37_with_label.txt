The bow stance head wrap action in this video is bad. The character begins in a neutral stance but quickly transitions into an improper 'Gong Bu' (bow stance). Instead of stepping forward with one leg and bending the knee to approximately 90 degrees, the character steps forward with both legs bent at a similar angle, which is not consistent with the ideal form. Additionally, the character does not maintain a clear alignment of the front knee over the ankle, as it appears to be more parallel to the ground. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining proper footwork by stepping forward with one leg while keeping the other leg straight, and ensure that the front knee remains aligned over the ankle throughout the movement.
