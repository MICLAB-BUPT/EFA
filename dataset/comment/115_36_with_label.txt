The staff flourish action in this video is bad because the person is not performing the movements with the correct technique, as evidenced by the lack of control and fluidity in their motions. The movements are choppy and do not flow smoothly, which suggests that the practitioner may not have a strong foundation in staff work or is not practicing with proper form. To improve, the person should focus on developing better control over their hands and wrists, ensuring that each movement is executed with precision and grace. This would involve practicing basic techniques until they become more natural and fluid, allowing for smoother transitions between movements.
