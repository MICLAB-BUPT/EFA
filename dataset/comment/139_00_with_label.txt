The sword sweep action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance, holding the sword firmly but not rigidly. They initiate the sweeping motion from the waist and hips, maintaining a consistent blade angle throughout the movement. The body rotation and arm extension are coordinated with a stepping motion to increase reach and power. The character completes the sweep by bringing the sword to a controlled stop, maintaining stability and balance. These aspects demonstrate good technique and precision in executing the sword sweep.
