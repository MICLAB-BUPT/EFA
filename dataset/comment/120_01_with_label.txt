The elbow whip action in this video is good. The person begins in a stable stance, holding the handle of the whip firmly with one hand. They prepare for the elbow-hooking or elbow-turning action by positioning their elbow as a pivot point. As the whip moves, they use their elbow to redirect its momentum, creating a sudden change in direction and adding a snapping motion. The person completes the technique with control over the whip throughout the movement. The execution demonstrates good form and precision, with the wrist and forearm playing a critical role in controlling the whip's movement.
