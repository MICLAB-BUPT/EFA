The cross drape red action in this video is good. The person starts by holding the rope of the Liuxingchui, then initiates the 'Shi Zi' pattern with a smooth swing of the hammer head to create a cross-shaped motion. They execute the vertical component, swinging the hammer head upwards and downwards, followed by the horizontal component across their body. Finally, they transition into the 'Shi Zi Pi Hong' combination, creating a continuous, flowing movement. The person maintains a secure grip on the rope and demonstrates precise control throughout the sequence. To refine their technique further, they could work on the fluidity and speed of their movements, ensuring that each step of the pattern flows seamlessly into the next, enhancing the overall artistry and precision of the cross drape red.
