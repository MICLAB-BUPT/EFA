The dcline barbell bench press action in this video is good. The person starts by lying on the decline bench with their feet secured under the pads, ensuring a safe and efficient unrack. They grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using a full grip (thumb wrapped around the bar), which is appropriate for this exercise. As they unrack the barbell, they keep their wrists straight and elbows slightly unlocked, taking a deep breath and bracing the core to stabilize the torso. They lower the barbell under control, touching it to the lower chest, maintaining a roughly 45-degree angle to the body, and avoiding excessive flaring of the elbows to protect the shoulders. Finally, they push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending their arms, keeping a slight bend in the elbows at the top. This demonstrates proper form and technique for a dcline barbell bench press.
