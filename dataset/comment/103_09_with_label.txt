The horse stance punch action in this video is good. The person maintains a solid 'Ma Bu' (horse stance) with feet positioned significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward, and knees deeply bent. The hand positioning is also appropriate, with one hand chambered at the waist in a fist and the other hand in a guard position. The person initiates the 'Chong Quan' (thrusting punch) with a slight rotation of the waist and extends the punching arm forward while maintaining stability and balance. The retraction of the fist back to the chambered position at the waist is also done smoothly. Overall, the execution of the horse stance punch is well-coordinated and demonstrates good technique.
