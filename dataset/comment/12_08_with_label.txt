The dumbbell lateral raise action in this video is good. The individual maintains a slight bend in the elbows throughout the exercise, which helps to avoid locking them out and prevents potential injury. The person keeps the core engaged and maintains an upright posture with the chest up and shoulders back, ensuring proper form and avoiding slouching or leaning forward. The movement is controlled as the individual raises the arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, focusing on lifting with the medial deltoids. The lowering phase is also controlled, emphasizing the importance of resisting the urge to drop the dumbbells. These aspects contribute to effective muscle engagement and a safe workout routine.
