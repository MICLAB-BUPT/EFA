The barbell back squat action in this video is good. The character starts with the barbell resting across their upper back, which is a comfortable position for them. They maintain a stance width slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with toes pointed outward, ensuring stability and comfort during the exercise. The character also takes a deep breath and braces the core, creating intra-abdominal pressure to support the spine. Throughout the descent, they maintain a neutral spine and keep the chest up, which helps prevent injury and ensures proper form. Finally, the character drives through the heels, extending the hips and knees simultaneously to return to the starting position, maintaining a consistent back angle throughout the ascent. These actions collectively contribute to a well-executed barbell back squat, demonstrating good technique and control.
