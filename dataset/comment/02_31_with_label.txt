The barbell bent-over row action in this video is bad. The character's back is not straight, which could lead to poor posture and increased risk of injury. Additionally, the elbows are not close to the body, which can result in an ineffective rowing motion. To improve, the character should focus on keeping their back straight, ensuring their elbows remain close to their body, and maintaining control throughout the descent.
