The spear flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, and the spear does not trace clear patterns in the air. There is a lack of control over the spear, which is not close to the body and exhibits wild, uncontrolled swings. Additionally, there is a lack of precision and grace in the movements, making it difficult to see the elegance typically associated with a proper spear flourish. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining control of the spear, practicing smooth transitions between movements, and incorporating body movements that complement the spear techniques.
