The spear flourish action in this video is bad. The person is not holding the spear near the center or slightly towards the rear, but rather with a relaxed grip. This can lead to a lack of control and precision in the movements. Additionally, the person's stance is not balanced and agile, which can hinder free movement and rotation of the spear. The movements are not fluid and continuous, but rather appear to be more like random swings. The person is not focusing on maintaining control of the spear throughout the movements, as it moves wild and uncontrolled. The person does not incorporate body movement effectively, which can add complexity and dynamism to the flourish. Overall, the person lacks the skill and technique required for an ideal spear flourish.
