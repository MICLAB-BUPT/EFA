The block, seize, thrust action in this video is good. The person starts in a proper stance with their feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, providing a solid base for movement. They use the spear to deflect an incoming attack, executing a controlled block. Following this, they swiftly transition into a seizing or controlling action by using the spear shaft to trap the opponent's weapon. Finally, they perform a thrusting attack, extending the spear forward in a straight line. The sequence demonstrates good technique and coordination between the different actions, resulting in effective martial arts practice.
