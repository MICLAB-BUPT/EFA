The barbell glute bridge action in this video is good. The individual maintains proper form throughout the exercise, demonstrating a controlled and stable movement. The person lies on their back with their knees bent and feet flat on the ground, positioning the barbell across their hips securely. They brace their core and engage their abdominal muscles to stabilize the torso while driving through their heels and squeezing their glutes to lift the hips off the floor. The pause at the top of the bridge and the controlled descent are executed smoothly, indicating a strong understanding of the exercise technique.
