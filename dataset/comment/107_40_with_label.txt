The bow stance thrusting knife action in this video is bad because the character does not maintain a stable base or guard position, and the movement lacks precision. The character's posture is not consistent with the ideal 'Gong Bu' stance, and there is an absence of power and control during the thrust. To improve, the character should focus on establishing a proper guard position, maintaining balance, and ensuring that the thrust is executed with power and precision.
