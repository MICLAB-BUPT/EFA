The horse stance gather hand action in this video is bad. The character's feet are not significantly wider than shoulder-width apart, and the toes are not pointing forward or slightly outward. The knees are not deeply bent with thighs parallel to the ground (or as close as possible), and the back is not straight, indicating poor posture. To improve, the character should adjust their stance to meet the ideal standards for a proper horse stance.
