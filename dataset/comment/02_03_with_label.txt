The barbell bent-over row action in this video is good. The woman maintains a straight back and neutral head position, which helps avoid unnecessary strain on the spine. Her feet are shoulder-width apart, providing stability during the exercise. The barbell is held with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, allowing for a proper range of motion. As she pulls the barbell up towards her lower chest or upper abdomen, her elbows remain close to her body, ensuring that the movement is controlled and focused on the intended muscle group. She also maintains control throughout the descent, preventing momentum from swinging the weight. Overall, the woman's form and technique are well-executed, making this a good demonstration of the barbell bent-over row exercise.
