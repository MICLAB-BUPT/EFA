The left and right chopping knife action in this video is bad because the character does not maintain a proper grip on the Dao, which could lead to a loss of control and an increased risk of injury. Additionally, the character's movements are not fluid or controlled, indicating a lack of practice and understanding of the technique. To improve, the character should focus on developing a strong grip, maintaining balance, and practicing smooth transitions between movements.
