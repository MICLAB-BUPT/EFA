The sword chop action in this video is good. The character begins in a stable stance with the Jian held firmly but relaxed, preparing for the downward chopping motion. They raise the Jian above their head and position it for a clean cut, demonstrating proper technique. As they execute the 'Pi' ( pi ), they generate power from the ground through their legs and core, transferring it to the blade. The wrist and forearm control the blade's angle, ensuring a precise cut. Finally, the character brings the Jian to a lower position near the waist or thigh, completing the chop. This sequence shows a well-executed, powerful, and controlled sword chop that adheres to the ideal form steps provided.
