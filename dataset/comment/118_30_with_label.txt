The wrist flourish action in this video is bad. The character's movements are not fluid and continuous, which makes the 'Wan Hua' technique appear less visually appealing. Additionally, there is a lack of clear, distinct patterns created by the blade. To improve, the character should focus on maintaining control of the sword while practicing different variations of the wrist flower technique, gradually increasing speed and complexity as their wrist flexibility and control improve.
